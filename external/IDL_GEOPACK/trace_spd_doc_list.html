Procedure: trace2equator

Purpose: Generates a model field line footprint from an array of given
         positions and times, will also trace field lines at the user's request
         This program will always use the refined foot point mappings (a
         modification made by Vassilis Angelopoulos to provide more accurate
         mappings of foot points) as there is no Tsyganenko code to 
         perform equatorial traces.

Input:
         tarray: N length array storing the position times in seconds utc since 1970

         in_pos_array: Nx3 array representing the position series (in
             km gsm by default)

         out_foot_array: named variable in which to store the footprints
             calculated by this function(will be an Nx3 array) will be returned
             (in RE gsm by default)

Keywords:
         out_trace_array(optional): named variable in which to store the traces of
             field lines leading to footprints. Because traces are of variable
             length, the returned array will be of dimensions NxDx3
             D is the maximum number of vectors in any of the traces.
             Shorter traces will have NaNs filling the space at the end
             of the array  

         in_coord(optional): set this keyword to a string indicating the
             coordinate system input position data is in.
             (can be 'gei','gse','geo','gsm',or 'sm' default: gsm)

         out_coord(optional): set this keyword to a string indicating the
             coordinate system output data should be in.
             (can be 'gei','gse','geo','gsm',or 'sm' default: gsm)

         internal_model(optional): set this keyword to a string
             indicating the internal model that should be used in tracing
             (can be 'dip' or 'igrf' default:igrf)

         external_model(optional): set this keyword to a string
             indicating the external model that should be used in tracing
             (can be 'none','t89','t96','t01', or 't04s' default: none)

         SOUTH(optional): set this keyword to indicate that fields
             should be traced towards the southern hemisphere. By default
             they trace north.
         
         KM(optional): set this keyword to indicate that input
             and output will be in KM not RE
 
         par(optional): parameter input for the external field model
             if using t89 then it should be an N element array containing 
             kp values or a single kp value, if using t96,t01,t04s it
             should be an N x 10 element array of parmod values or a 10
             element array or a 1x10 element array. At the moment if an
             external model is set and this is not set an error will be
             thrown.
           
         period(optional): the amount of time between recalculations of
             geodipole tilt and input of new model parameters in
             seconds (default: 60) increase this value to decrease
             run time
             if field line traces are requested this parameter is
             ignored and new model parameters are input on each
             iteration

         error(optional): named variable in which to return the error state
             of the procedure.  1 for success, 0 for failure
             
         R0(optional):  radius of a sphere (in re), defining the inner boundary of the tracing region
         (usually, earth's surface or the ionosphere, where r0~1.0)
         if the field line reaches that sphere from outside, its inbound tracing is
         terminated and the crossing point coordinates xf,yf,zf  are calculated.
         (units are km if /km is set)

         RLIM(optional) - radius of a sphere (in re), defining the outer boundary of the tracing region;
         if the field line reaches that boundary from inside, its outbound tracing is
         terminated and the crossing point coordinates xf,yf,zf are calculated.(default 60 RE)
         (units are km if /km is set)   

         NOBOUNDARY(optional): Override boundary limits.

         STORM(optional): Specify storm-time version of T01 external 
             magnetic field model use together with /T01.

         add_tilt:  Increment the default dipole tilt used by the model with
             a user provided tilt in degrees.  Result will be produced with TSY_DEFAULT_TILT+ADD_TILT
             Value can be set to an N length array an M length array or a single element array. 
             N is the number of time elements for the data.  M is the number of periods in the time interval.(determined by the period keyword)
             If single element is provided the same correction will be applied to all periods.   
             If an N length array is provided, the data will be re-sampled to an M length array. Consequently, if
             the values change quickly, the period may need to be shortened. 
         
         get_tilt: Returns the dipole_tilt parameter used for each period. 
             Returned value has a number of elements equal to the value returned by get_nperiod
         
         set_tilt: Alternative alternative dipole_tilt value rather than the geopack tilt.
             This input can be an M length array, and N length array or a single elemnt.
             Value can be set to an N length array an M length array or a single element array. 
             N is the number of time elements for the data.  M is the number of periods in the time interval.(determined by the period keyword)
             If an N length array is provided, the data will be re-sampled to an M length array. Consequently, if
             the values change quickly, the period may need to be shortened. 
             set_tilt will cause add_tilt to be ignored. 
                   
         get_nperiod: Returns the number of periods used for the time interval=  ceil((end_time-start_time)/period)
     
         geopack_2008 (optional): Set this keyword to use the latest version (2008) of the Geopack
              library. Version 9.2 of the IDL Geopack DLM is required for this keyword to work.
Example: 
        trace2equator,in_time,in_pos,out_foot

Notes:
  1. Relies on the IDL/Geopack Module provided by Haje Korth JHU/APL
      and N.A. Tsyganenko NASA/GSFC, if the module is not installed
      this function will fail.  
  2. Has a loop with number of iterations =
      (tarray[n_elements(t_array)]-tarray[0])/period
      This means that as period becomes smaller the amount time of this
      function should take will grow quickly.
  3. If the trace_array variable is set
      the period variable will be ignored.  The program will
      recalculate for each value, this will cause the program to
      run very slowly. 
  4. All calculations are done internally in double precision

         perform equatorial traces.Model parameters can be provided
         in the par array or individually, using the
         parameter's name.  If a model parameter is provided
         by name, it will overwrite a part of any par value
         provided.  If a named parameter is provided, but is
         unneeded by the model, it will be ignored.

             of the array  

         in_coord(optional): set this keyword to the coordinate

              the input)

         internal_model(optional): set this keyword to a string
             indicating the internal model that should be used in tracing

         SOUTH(optional): set this keyword to indicate that fields
             should be traced towards the southern hemisphere. By default
             they trace north.
         
         KM(optional): set this keyword to indicate that input
             and output will be in KM not RE
 
         par(optional): parameter input for the external field model
             if using t89 then it should be an N element array containing 
             kp values or a single kp value, if using t96,t01,t04s it
             should be an N x 10 element array of parmod values or a 10
             element array. At the moment if an external model is set and
             this is not set an error will be thrown. This value can also
             be tplot variable name. If it is a tplot variable name it
             will be interpolated to match the positions in pos_tvar

             state of the procedure.  1 for success, 0 for failure

         R0(optional):  radius of a sphere (in re), defining the inner boundary of the tracing region
         (usually, earth's surface or the ionosphere, where r0~1.0)
         if the field line reaches that sphere from outside, its inbound tracing is

         if the field line reaches that boundary from inside, its outbound tracing is
         terminated and the crossing point coordinates xf,yf,zf are calculated.(default 60 RE)

See: crib_ttrace for more examples

Notes:
  1. Relies on the IDL/Geopack Module provided by Haje Korth JHU/APL
      and N.A. Tsyganenko NASA/GSFC, if the module is not installed
      this function will fail.  
  2. Has a loop with number of iterations =
      (tarray[n_elements(t_array)]-tarray[0])/period
      This means that as period becomes smaller the amount time of this
      function should take will grow quickly.
  3. If the trace_array variable is set
      the period variable will be ignored.  The program will
      recalculate for each value, this will cause the program to
      run very slowly. 
  4. All calculations are done internally in double precision

<PRE>
Procedure : ttrace2iono

Purpose: tplot wrapper for field line footprint and tracing routines
         This program will always use the refined foot point mappings
         (a modification made by Vassilis Angelopoulos to provide more
         accurate mappings of foot points) unless you request the standard
         mapping. Model parameters can be provided in the par array
         or individually, using the parameter's name.  If a model parameter
         is provided by name, it will overwrite an par value
         provided.  If a named parameter is provided, but is
         unneeded by the model, it will be ignored.

Input:
         in_pos_tvar: name of the tplot variable storing the
             position information for tracing, input values should be in
             'gse','gei','gsm',or 'sm'

Keywords:
         newname(optional): name of the tplot variable in which output
             footprints should be stored(default: in_pos_tvar+'_foot')

         trace_var_name(optional): name of the tplot variable in
             which to store the traces of field lines leading to footprints. 
             Because traces are of variable length, the returned array
             will be of dimensions NxDx3
             D is the maximum number of vectors in any of the traces.
             Shorter traces will have NaNs filling the space at the end
             of the array  

         in_coord(optional): set this keyword to the coordinate
             system of the input, defaults to 'gsm', must match tplot
             meta data

         out_coord(optional): set this keyword to a string indicating
             the coordinate system output data should be in, defaults to 'gsm'
             (can be 'geo','gei','gse','gsm',or 'sm' default: the same as
              the input)

         internal_model(optional): set this keyword to a string
             indicating the internal model that should be used in tracing
             (can be 'dip' or 'igrf' default:igrf)

         external_model(optional): set this keyword to a string
             indicating the external model that should be used in tracing
             (can be 'none','t89','t96','t01', or 't04s' default: none)

         SOUTH(optional): set this keyword to indicate that fields
             should be traced towards the southern hemisphere. By default
             they trace north.
         
         KM(optional): set this keyword to indicate that input
             and output will be in KM not RE
 
         par(optional): parameter input for the external field model
             if using t89 then it should be an N element array containing 
             kp values or a single kp value, if using t96,t01,t04s it
             should be an N x 10 element array of parmod values or a 10
             element array or a 1x10 element array. At the moment if an
             external model is set and this is not set an error will be
             thrown. This can also contain a string naming a tplot 
             variable storing the par values. If a tplot variable is 
             named it will also be interpolated to match the position
             data.
           
         period(optional): the amount of time between recalculations of
             geodipole tilt and input of new model parameters in
             seconds (default: 60) increase this value to decrease
             run time 
             if field line traces are requested this parameter is
             ignored and new model parameters are input on each
             iteration

         error(optional): named variable in which to return the error
             state of the procedure.  1 for success, 0 for failure
         
         standard_mapping(optional): Set to use Tsyganenko's
             unmodified version instead of the Angelopoulos's 
             refined version

        R0(optional):  radius of a sphere (in re), defining the inner boundary of the tracing region
         (usually, earth's surface or the ionosphere, where r0~1.0)
         if the field line reaches that sphere from outside, its inbound tracing is
         terminated and the crossing point coordinates xf,yf,zf  are calculated.
         (units are km if /km is set)

         RLIM(optional) - radius of a sphere (in re), defining the outer boundary of the tracing region;
         if the field line reaches that boundary from inside, its outbound tracing is
         terminated and the crossing point coordinates xf,yf,zf are calculated.(default 60 RE)
