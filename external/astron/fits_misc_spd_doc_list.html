 NAME:
   BLKSHIFT

 PURPOSE:
   Shift a block of data to a new position in a file (possibly overlapping)

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

   BLKSHIFT, UNIT, POS, [ DELTA, TO=TO, /NOZERO, ERRMSG=ERRMSG, 
             BUFFERSIZE=BUFFERSIZE ]

 DESCRIPTION:

  BLKSHIFT moves a block of data forward or backward, to a new
  position in a data file.  The old and new positions of the block
  can overlap safely.

  The new position can be specified with either the DELTA parameter,
  which gives the number of bytes to move forward (positive delta) or
  backward (negative delta); or the TO keyword, which give the new
  absolute starting position of the block.

  The block can be moved beyond the current end of file point, in
  which case the intervening gap is filled with zeros (optionally).
  The gap left at the old position of the block is also optionally
  zero-filled.    If a set of data up to the end of the file is being
  moved forward (thus making the file smaller) then
  the file is truncated at the new end.using TRUNCATE_LUN.

 INPUTS:

   UNIT - a logical unit number, opened for reading and writing.

   POS - POS[0] is the position of the block in the file, in bytes,
         before moving.  POS[1], if present, is the size of the block
         in bytes.  If POS[1] is not given, then the block is from
         POS[0] to the end of the file.

   DELTA - the (optional) offset in bytes between the old and new
           positions, from the start of the block.  Positive values
           indicate moving the data forward (toward the end of file),
           and negative values indicate moving the data backward
           (toward the beginning of the file).  One of DELTA and TO
           must be specified; DELTA overrides the TO keyword.

           Attempts to move the block beyond the end of the file will
           succeed.  A block can never be moved beyond the beginning
           of the file; it will be moved to the beginning instead.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

   TO - the absolute file offset in bytes for the new start of the
        block.  One of DELTA and TO must be specified; DELTA
        overrides the TO keyword.

   /NOZERO - if set, then newly created gaps will not be explicitly
            zeroed.   Note that in same systems (e.g. MacOS) the gaps will
            always be zeroed whether or not /NOZERO is set.

   ERRMSG - If defined and passed, then any error messages will be
            returned to the user in this parameter rather than
            depending on the MESSAGE routine in IDL.  If no errors
            are encountered, then a null string is returned.  

			BLKSHIFT, UNIT, POS, DElTA, ERRMSG=ERRMSG, ...
			IF ERRMSG NE '' THEN ...

   BUFFERSIZE - the maximum buffer size for transfers, in bytes.
                Larger values of this keyword impose larger memory
                requirements on the application; smaller values will
                lead to more transfer operations.
                Default: 32768 (bytes)

 NAME:
       CHECKSUM32

 PURPOSE:
       To compute the 32bit checksum of an array (ones-complement arithmetic)

 EXPLANATION:
       The 32bit checksum is adopted in the FITS Checksum convention
       http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/registry/checksum.html

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       CHECKSUM32, array, checksum, [/FROM_IEEE, /NoSAVE, /Incremental]

 INPUTS:
       array - any numeric idl array.  If the number of bytes in the array is 
               not a multiple of four then it is padded with zeros internally
               (the array is returned unchanged).   Convert a string array 
               (e.g. a FITS header) to bytes prior to calling CHECKSUM32.

 INPUT-OUTPUT:
       checksum - unsigned long scalar, giving sum of array elements using 
                ones-complement arithmetic.    This is normally an output
                parameter, but can also be an input parameter if /Incremental 
                is set.  
 OPTIONAL INPUT KEYWORD:

      /FROM_IEEE - If this keyword is set, then the input is assumed to be in
           big endian format (e.g. an untranslated FITS array).   This keyword
           only has an effect on little endian machines (e.g. Linux boxes).

      /Incremental - If this keyword is set, use the checksum
           parameter as input of a partial checksum from a previous
           call, allowing checksums for large arrays to be calculated 
           incrementally. 

      /NoSAVE - if set, then the input array is not saved upon exiting.   Use 
           the /NoSave keyword to save time if the input array is not needed 
           in further computations. 
 METHOD:
       Uses TOTAL() to sum the array into an unsigned integer variable.  The
       overflow bits beyond 2^32 are then shifted back to the least significant
       bits.    The summing is done in chunks of 2^31 numbers to avoid loss
      of precision.    Adapted from FORTRAN code in
      heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/ofwg/docs/general/checksum/node30.html

 RESTRICTIONS:
       (1) Not valid for object or pointer data types
 EXAMPLE:
        (1) Find the 32 bit checksum of the array x = findgen(35)

       IDL&gt; checksum32, x, s    ===&gt; s =  2920022024

        (2) Find the checksum of an array too large to fit in memory at one time
            by breaking it up into 15 pieces.

       IDL&gt; a = randomn(seed,100,100, 15)
		IDL&gt; for i=0,14 do checksum32,a[*, *,i], checksum_incr, /incremental

 NAME:
     FDECOMP
 PURPOSE:
     Routine to decompose file name(s) for any operating system.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
     FDECOMP, filename, disk, dir, name, qual, [OSFamily = ]

 INPUT:
     filename - string file name(s), scalar or vector

 OUTPUTS:
     All the output parameters will have the same number of elements as 
       input filename 

       disk - disk name, always '' on a Unix machine, scalar or vector string
       dir - directory name, scalar or vector string
       name - file name, scalar or vector string 
       qual - qualifier, set equal to the characters beyond the last &quot;.&quot;

 OPTIONAL INPUT KEYWORD:
     OSFamily -  scalar string specifying the operating system, must be either
             'Windows' or 'unix'.    If not supplied,
             then !VERSION.OS_FAMILY is used to determine the OS.
 EXAMPLES:
     Consider the following file names 

     unix:    file = '/itt/idl71/avg.pro' 
     Windows: file =  'd:\itt\idl71\avg.pro'
       
     then IDL&gt; FDECOMP,  file, disk, dir, name, qual
       will return the following

                 Disk             Dir          Name        Qual    
       Unix:      ''            '/itt/idl71/'  'avg'       'pro'   
       Windows:    'd:'         \itt\idl71\    'avg'       'pro'   

 NOTES:
     (1) The period is removed between the name and qualifier 
     (2) Unlike the intrinsic FILE_BASENAME() and FILE_DIRNAME() functions,
         one can use FDECOMP to decompose a Windows file name on a Unix machine
         or a Unix filename on a Windows machine.

 ROUTINES CALLED:
     None.

 NAME:
	GETTOK                                    
 PURPOSE:
	Retrieve the first part of a (vector) string up to a specified character
 EXPLANATION:
	GET TOKen - Retrieve first part of string until the character char 
	is encountered.   

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	token = gettok( st, char, [ /EXACT, /NOTRIM ] )

 INPUT:
	char - character separating tokens, scalar string

 INPUT-OUTPUT:
	st - string to get token from (on output token is removed unless
            /NOTRIM is set), scalar or vector

 OUTPUT:
	token - extracted string value is returned, same dimensions as st
 OPTIONAL INPUT KEYWORD:
       /EXACT -  The default behaviour of GETTOK is to remove any leading 
              blanks and (if the token is a blank) convert tabs to blanks.    
              Set the /EXACT keyword to skip these steps and leave the 
              input string unchanged before searching for the  character 
              tokens. 

      /NOTRIM - if set, then the input string is left unaltered 
 EXAMPLE:
	If ST is ['abc=999','x=3.4234'] then gettok(ST,'=') would return
	['abc','x'] and ST would be left as ['999','3.4234']

 NAME:
       HPRINT
 PURPOSE:
       Display a FITS header (or other string array) 
 EXPLANATION:
       On a GUI terminal, the string array is displayed using XDISPSTR.    
       If printing at a non-GUI terminal, the string array is  printed 1 line 
       at a  time, to make sure that each element of the string array is 
       displayed on a separate line. 

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       HPRINT, h, [ firstline ]

 INPUTS:
       H - FITS header (or any other string array).

 OPTIONAL INPUT:
       FIRSTLINE - scalar integer specifying the first line to begin 
               displaying.   The default is FIRSTLINE = 1, i.e. display 
               all the lines.     If Firstline is negative, then the first
               line to be printed is counted backward from the last line.

 NOTES:
       When displaying at the terminal, HPRINT has the following differences 
       from the intrinsic PRINT procedure

       (1) Arrays are printed one line at a time to avoid a space between 80
               character lines
       (2) Lines are trimmed with STRTRIM before being printed to speed up 
               display
       (3) The /more option is used for output. 

 EXAMPLE:
       Read the header from a FITS file named 'test.fits' and display it at the
       terminal beginning with line 50

       IDL&gt; h = headfits( 'test.fits')         ;Read FITS header
       IDL&gt; hprint, h, 50                      ;Display starting at line 50

       To print the last 25 lines of the header

       IDL&gt; hprint, h, -25

 NAME:
       MRD_SKIP
 PURPOSE:
       Skip a number of bytes from the current location in a file or a pipe
 EXPLANATION:
       First tries using POINT_LUN and if this doesn't work, perhaps because
       the unit is a pipe or a socket, MRD_SKIP will just read in the 
       requisite number  of bytes.    
 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       MRD_SKIP, Unit, Nskip

 INPUTS:
       Unit - File unit for the file or pipe in question, integer scalar
       Nskip - Number of bytes to be skipped, positive integer
 NOTES:
       This routine should be used in place of POINT_LUN wherever a pipe
       or socket may be the input unit (see the procedure FXPOSIT for an 
       example).   Note that it assumes that it can only work with nskip &gt;= 0 
       so it doesn't even try for negative values.      

       For reading a pipe, MRD_SKIP currently uses a maximum buffer size
       of 8 MB.   This chunk value can be increased for improved efficiency
       (or decreased if you really have little memory.)
 REVISION HISTORY:
       Written, Thomas A. McGlynn    July 1995
	Don't even try to skip bytes on a pipe with POINT_LUN, since this
	might reset the current pointer     W. Landsman        April 1996

 NAME:
       MRD_STRUCT
 PURPOSE:
       Return a structure as defined in the names and values data.
 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       struct = MRD_STRUCT(NAMES, VALUES, NROW, STRUCTYP='name' )
 INPUT PARAMETERS:
       NAMES   = A string array of names of structure fields.
       VALUES  = A string array giving the values of the structure
                 fields.  See examples below.
       NROW    = The number of elements in the structure array.
       
 RETURNS:
       A structure as described in the parameters or 0 if an error
       is detected.

 OPTIONAL KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
       /NO_EXECUTE - If set then the use of the EXECUTE() statement is avoided.
                  By default, the NO_EXECUTE pathway is used if IDL is 
                  running under the Virtual Machine.    Note if  /NO_EXECUTE
                  is set, then the user cannot supply arbitrary values, but
                  all possible values used by MRDFITS will be allowed.
       STRUCTYP = The structure type.  Since IDL does not allow the
                  redefinition of a named structure it is an error
                  to call MRD_STRUCT with different parameters but
                  the same STRUCTYP in the same session.  If this
                  keyword is not set an anonymous structure is created.
 COMMON BLOCKS:
       MRD_COMMON
 SIDE EFFECTS:                                                            
       May create a temporary file if the structure definition is too long 
       for the EXECUTE function and using old style structures

 RESTRICTIONS:
       By default, the program defines the structure in a long string
       which is executed with CREATE_STRUCT within a single EXECUTE statement.

       If program is being run in the IDL Virtual machine (EXECUTE statement
       not allowed), then a separate CREATE_STRUCT statement is called
       for each tag.   This mode does not have the full capabilities of the
       normal mode, but should be sufficient for use with MRDFITS().
 PROCEDURE:
       A structure definition is created using the parameter values.
       MRD_NSTRUCT is called  and generates the structure in pieces using the
       execute and create_struct keywords.

 EXAMPLES:
       (1) str = mrd_struct(['fld1', 'fld2'], ['0','dblarr(10,10)'],3)
           print, str(0).fld2(3,3)
       Note that &quot;0&quot; is always considered short integer even if the default
       integer is set to long.
          

       (2) str = mrd_struct(['a','b','c','d'],['1', '1.', '1.d0', &quot;'1'&quot;],1)
               ; returns a structure with integer, float, double and string
               ; fields.
 PROCEDURE CALLS:
       GETTOK() - needed for virtual machine mode only
 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
       Created by T. McGlynn October, 1994.
       Modified by T. McGlynn September, 1995.
          Added capability to create substructures so that structure
          may contain up to 4096 distinct elements.  [This can be
          increased by futher iteration of the process used if needed.]
       Removed V4.0 reference to common block  October 1997
       Allowed unlimited number of structure elements if the version
       is greater than 5.0.  Put back in code to handle prior versions.
       The [] will need to be translated back to () for this to
       work.  T. McGlynn December 15 1998.
       Add MRD_NSTRUCT since IDL has mysterious problems compiling
       very large structures.
       Removed TEMPDIR and OLD_STRUCT keywords  W. Landsman October 2003   
       Alternate pathway without EXECUTE for V6.0 virtual machine, D. Lindler
       Removed limit on EXECUTE statement.  W. Landsman  October 2003
       Restore EXECUTE limit (sigh...), added NO_EXECUTE keyword
                         W. Landsman July 2004
       Fix use of STRUCTYP with /NO_EXECUTE  W. Landsman June 2005
       Assume since V6.0 (lmgr function available), remove 131 string length
             limit for execute    W. Landsman Jun 2009 
       Restore EXECUTE limit (sigh...)   W. Landsman July 2009 
       Make sure &quot;0&quot; is a short integer even with compile_opt idl2  July 2010
       Added &quot;0.0&quot;, &quot;0.0d&quot;, &quot;0u&quot;, &quot;0ul&quot;, and &quot;0ull&quot; as valid tags
             for /NO_EXECUTE  E. Rykoff May 2012

 NAME:
       N_bytes()

 PURPOSE:
       To return the total number of bytes in data element

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = N_bytes(a)

 INPUTS:
       a - any idl data element, scalar or array

 OUTPUTS:
       total number of bytes in a is returned as the function value
       (64bit longword scalar)
 NOTES:
       (1) Not valid for object or pointer data types
       (2) For a string array, the number of bytes is computed after conversion
           with the BYTE() function, i.e. each element has the same length,
           equal to the maximum individual string length.

 NAME:
     SPEC_DIR()
 PURPOSE:
     Complete a file specification by appending the default disk or directory

 CALLING SEQUENCE:                      
     File_spec = SPEC_DIR( filename, [ extension ] )
 INPUT:
     filename - character string giving partial specification of a file
               name.  Examples for different operating systems include the
                       following:
               Unix: 'pro/test.dat', '$IDL_HOME/test','~/subpro'
               MacOS: ':Programs:test'
               Windows: '\pro\test.dat','d:\pro\test'

 OPTIONAL INPUT:
     exten - string giving a default file name extension to be used if
             filename does not contain one.  Do not include the period.

 OUTPUT:
     File_spec - Complete file specification using default disk or 
               directory when necessary.  

 EXAMPLE:
      IDL&gt; a = spec_dir('test','dat')

      is equivalent to the commands
      IDL&gt; cd, current=cdir
      IDL&gt; a = cdir + delim + 'test.dat'

      where delim is the OS-dependent separator 
 METHOD:
      SPEC_DIR() decomposes the file name using FDECOMP, and appends the 
      default directory (obtained from the FILE_EXPAND_PATH) if necessary.   

      SPEC_DIR() does not check whether the constructed file name actually
      exists.
 PROCEDURES CALLED:

 NAME:
	STRN
 PURPOSE:
	Convert a number to a string and remove padded blanks.
 EXPLANATION:
	The main and original purpose of this procedure is to convert a number
	to an unpadded string (i.e. with no blanks around it.)  However, it 
	has been expanded to be a multi-purpose formatting tool.  You may 
	specify a length for the output string; the returned string is either 
	set to that length or padded to be that length.  You may specify 
	characters to be used in padding and which side to be padded.  Finally,
	you may also specify a format for the number.  NOTE that the input 
	&quot;number&quot; need not be a number; it may be a string, or anything.  It is
	converted to string.

 CALLING SEQEUNCE:
	tmp = STRN( number, [ LENGTH=, PADTYPE=, PADCHAR=, FORMAT = ] )

 INPUT:
	NUMBER    This is the input variable to be operated on.  Traditionally,
		 it was a number, but it may be any scalar type.

 OPTIONAL INPUT:
	LENGTH    This KEYWORD specifies the length of the returned string.  
		If the output would have been longer, it is truncated.  If 
		the output would have been shorter, it is padded to the right 
		length.
	PADTYPE   This KEYWORD specifies the type of padding to be used, if any.
		0=Padded at End, 1=Padded at front, 2=Centered (pad front/end)
		IF not specified, PADTYPE=1
	PADCHAR   This KEYWORD specifies the character to be used when padding.
		The default is a space (' ').
	FORMAT    This keyword allows the FORTRAN type formatting of the input
		number (e.g. '(f6.2)')

 OUTPUT:
	tmp       The formatted string

 USEFUL EXAMPLES:
	print,'Used ',strn(stars),' stars.'  ==&gt; 'Used 22 stars.'
	print,'Attempted ',strn(ret,leng=6,padt=1,padch='0'),' retries.'
		==&gt; 'Attempted 000043 retries.'
	print,strn('M81 Star List',length=80,padtype=2)
		==&gt; an 80 character line with 'M81 Star List' centered.
	print,'Error: ',strn(err,format='(f15.2)')
		==&gt; 'Error: 3.24'     or ==&gt; 'Error: 323535.22'

 NAME:
       TEXTOPEN
 PURPOSE:
       Open a device specified by TEXTOUT with unit !TEXTUNIT 
 EXPLANATION:
       Procedure to open file for text output.   The type of output 
       device (disk file or terminal screen) is specified by the 
       TEXTOUT keyword or the (nonstandard) system variable !TEXTOUT.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       textopen, program, [ TEXTOUT =, /STDOUT, /SILENT, MORE_SET=, WIDTH= ]

 INPUTS:
       program - scalar string giving name of program calling textopen

 OPTIONAL INPUT KEYWORDS:
       TEXTOUT - Integer scalar (0-7) specifying output file/device to be 
               opened (see below) or scalar string giving name of output file.
               If TEXTOUT is not supplied, then the (non-standard) system 
               variable !TEXTOUT is used.
       /SILENT - By default, TEXTOPEN prints an informational message when
                opening a file for hardcopy output.   Set /SILENT (or !QUIET)
                to suppress this message.
       /STDOUT - if this keyword is set and non-zero, then the standard output
               (unit = -1) is used for TEXTOUT=1 or TEXTOUT=2.   The use
               of STDOUT has  2 possible advantages:
               (1) the output will appear in a journal file
               (2) Many Unix machines print spurious control characters when
               printing to /dev/tty.   These characters are eliminated by 
               setting /STDOUT

               The disadvantage of /STDOUT is that the /MORE option is not
               available.

         WIDTH - Specify line width for hardcopy output line wrapping (passed onto OPENW).

 OPTIONAL OUTPUT KEYWORD:
       MORE_SET - Returns 1 if the output unit was opened with /MORE.   This
               occurs if (1) TEXTOUT = 1 and (2) the device is a tty, and 
               (3) /STDOUT is not set.      User can use the returned value
                of MORE_SET to determine whether to end output when user
                presses 'Q'.
 SIDE EFFECTS:
       The following dev/file is opened for output.    Different effects
       occur depending whether the standard output is a GUI (Macintosh,
       Windows, Unix/IDLTool) or a TTY

               textout=0       Nowhere
               textout=1       if a TTY then TERMINAL using /more option
                                   otherwise standard (Unit=-1) output
               textout=2       if a TTY then TERMINAL without /more option
                                   otherwise standard (Unit=-1) output
               textout=3       &lt;program&gt;.prt
               textout=4       laser.tmp
               textout=5      user must open file
               textout=7      same as 3 but text is appended to &lt;program&gt;.prt
                               file if it already exists.
               textout = filename (default extension of .prt)

       The unit to be opened is obtained with the procedure GET_LUN
       unless !TEXTOUT=5.  The unit number is placed in system variable 
       !TEXTUNIT.  For !TEXTOUT=5 the user must set !TEXTUNIT to the 
       appropriate unit number.

 NOTES:
       When printing to a TTY terminal, the output will *not* appear in an 
       IDL JOURNAL session, unlike text printed with the PRINT command.

 NON-STANDARD SYSTEM VARIABLES:
       TEXTOPEN will automatically define the following system variables if
       they are not previously defined:

       DEFSYSV,'!TEXTOUT',1
       DEFSYSV,'!TEXTUNIT',0

 PURPOSE:
       Translate a non-negative decimal integer to a hexadecimal string
 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       HEX = TO_HEX( D, [ NCHAR ] )
 INPUTS:
       D - non-negative decimal integer, scalar or vector.  If input as a
           string, (e.g. '32') then all leading blanks are removed.

 OPTIONAL INPUT:
       NCHAR - number of characters in the output hexadecimal string.
               If not supplied, then the hex string will contain no 
               leading zeros.

 OUTPUT:
       HEX - hexadecimal translation of input integer, string

 EXAMPLES:
       IDL&gt; A = TO_HEX([11,16])    ==&gt;   A = ['B','10']
       IDL&gt; A = TO_HEX(100,3) ==&gt;   A = '064'

 METHOD:

 NAME: 
     VALID_NUM()
 PURPOSE:               
     Check if a string is a valid number representation.
 EXPLANATION:              
     The input string is parsed for characters that may possibly
     form a valid number.  It is more robust than simply checking
     for an IDL conversion error because that allows strings such
     as '22.3qwert' to be returned as the valid number 22.3

     This function had a major rewrite in August 2008 to use STREGEX
     and allow vector input.    It should be backwards compatible.
 CALLING SEQUENCE: 
     IDL&gt; status = valid_num(string  [,value]  [,/integer])
    
 INPUTS:
     string  -  the string to be tested, scalar or array
               
 RETURNS
     status - byte scalar or array, same size as the input string
              set to 1 where the string is a  valid number, 0 for invalid
 OPTIONAL OUTPUT:               
     value     - The value the string decodes to, same size as input string.
           This will be returned as a double precision number unless 
           /INTEGER is present, in which case a long integer is returned.
           
 OPTIONAL INPUT KEYWORD:          
    /INTEGER   -  if present code checks specifically for an integer.
 EXAMPLES:
     (1) IDL&gt; print,valid_num(3.2,/integer) 
        --&gt; 0     ;Since 3.2 is not an integer 
     (2) IDL&gt; str =['-0.03','2.3g', '3.2e12']
