PROCEDURE:       MVN_STA_3D_SNAP

PURPOSE:         Plots 3D (angular) snapshots in a separate window
                 for times selected with the cursor in a tplot window.
                 Hold down the left mouse button and slide for a movie effect.
                 This version uses 'plot3d' (or 'spec3d') on packaged 3D data.

INPUTS:          None. 
                 But the specified time (or [tmin, tmax]) is set, it
                 automatically show the snapshot. In this case, the
                 cursor does not appear in a tplot window. 

KEYWORDS:

   EBINS:        Energy bins to plot (passed to plot3d). 
                 Default = ddd.nenergy.

   CENTER:       Longitude and latitude of the center [lon, lat].

   MAP:          Mapping projection. See 'plot3d_options' for details.

   SPEC:         Plots energy spectra using 'spec3d'.
                 (Not working yet.)

   UNITS:        Units for the 'spec3d'.
                 (Not working yet.)

   ENERGY:       One or more energies to plot.  Overrides &quot;EBINS&quot;.

   DDD:          Named variable to hold a 3D structure including mass
                 at the last time selected.

   SUM:          If set, use cursor to specify time ranges for averaging.

   SMO:          Sets smoothing in energy and angle.  Since there are only
                 4 theta bins depending APIDs, smoothing in that dimension is not recommended.

                 smo = [n_energy, n_phi, n_theta]  ; default = [1,1,1]

                 This routine takes into account the 360-0 degree wrap when 
                 smoothing (But not working yet).

   SUNDIR:       Plots the direction of the Sun in STATIC coordinates.
                 (Not working yet.)

   LABEL:        If set, label the 3D angle bins.

   KEEPWINS:     If set, then don't close the snapshot window(s) on exit.

   ARCHIVE:      If set, show snapshots of archive data.

   BURST:        Synonym for &quot;ARCHIVE&quot;.

   MASK_SC:      Masks solid angle bins that are blocked by the spacecraft.
                 (Not working yet.)

   MASS:         Selects ion mass/charge range to show. Default is all.

   MMIN:         Defines the minimum ion mass/charge to use.
 
   MMAX:         Defines the maximum ion mass/charge to use.

   M_INT:        Assumes ion mass/charge. Default = 1.

   ERANGE:       If set, plots energy ranges for averaging.

   WINDOW:       Sets the window number to show. Default = 0.

   MSODIR:       Plots the direction of the MSO axes in STATIC coordinates. 

   APPDIR:       Plots the direction of the APP boom in STATIC coordinates.  

   APID:         If set, specifies the APID data product to use. 

   PLOT_SC:      Overplots the projection of the spacecraft body.

   SWIA:         Overplots the SWIA FOV in STATIC coordidates in
                 order to make sure the FOV overlap each other.

   ZLOG:         Sets a logarithmic color bar scaling. 

   CT:           Sets a color table number based on 'loadct2'.
                 Default is 34 (Rainbow).

NOTE:            This routine is written based on partially 'swe_3d_snap'
                 created by Dave Mitchell.

USAGE EXAMPLES: 
                 1.
                 mvn_sta_3d_snap, erange=[0.1, 1.d4], wi=1, /mso, /app, /label, /plot_sc

                 2.
                 ctime, t ; Clicks once or twice on the tplot window.
                 mvn_sta_3d_snap, t, erange=[0.1, 1.d4], wi=1, /mso, /app, /label, /plot_sc

                 3.
                 ctime, routine='mvn_sta_3d_snap'

PROCEDURE:       MVN_STA_SLICE2D_SNAP

PURPOSE:         Plots 2D slice for the times and data type selected by cursor.
                 Hold down the left mouse button and slide for a movie effect. 
                 
INPUTS:          None.
                 But the specified time (or [tmin, tmax]) is set, it
                 automatically show the snapshot. In this case, the
                 cursor does not appear in a tplot window.

CAUTION:         *** !!! ***
                 The velocity is computed under the assumption that  
                 all the observed ions are protons (i.e., m/q = 1) as default.
                 If user wants to show it as the other ion species, such as O+ or O2+, 
                 user must use the &quot;m_int&quot; keyword like m_int=16 or m_int=32. 
                 Please see also the usage example #2.
                 *** !!! ***

KEYWORDS:        All the keywords included in 'slice2d' are acceptable.

       MSO:      Rotates into the MSO coordinates (no effect on 'BV',
                 'BE', and 'perp' cuts).

     V_ESC:      Overplot a circle with radius = escape velocity.

      DIAG:      Print out diagnistics on the plot: S/C pot, S/C velocity

USAGE EXAMPLES:
         1.      ; Normal case
                 ; Uses archive data, and shows the B field direction.
                 ; Draws the Xmso-Zmso plane slice.

NOTE:            This routine is written partially based on 'mvn_swia_slice2d_snap'
                 created by Yuki Harada.
