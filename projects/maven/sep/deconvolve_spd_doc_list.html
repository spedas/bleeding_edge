 NAME:
	AMOEBA

 PURPOSE:
	Multidimensional minimization of a function FUNC(X), where
	X is an N-dimensional vector, using the downhill simplex
	method of Nelder and Mead, 1965, Computer Journal, Vol 7, pp 308-313.

	This routine is based on the AMOEBA routine, Numerical
	Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing (Second Edition), Page
	411, and is used by permission.

 CATEGORY:
	Function minimization/maximization. Simplex method.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	Result = AMOEBA(Ftol, ....)
 INPUTS:
    FTOL:  the fractional tolerance to be achieved in the function
	value.  e.g. the fractional decrease in the function value in the
	terminating step.  This should never be less than the
	machine's single or double precision.
 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
    FUNCTION_NAME: a string containing the name of the function to
	be minimized.  If omitted, the function FUNC is minimized.
	This function must accept an Ndim vector as its only parameter and
	return a scalar single or double precision floating point value as its
	result. 
    FUNCTION_VALUE: (output) on exit, an Ndim+1 element vector
	containing the function values at the simplex points.  The first
	element contains the function minimum. 
    NCALLS: (output) the of times the function was evaluated. 
    NMAX: the maximum number of function evaluations allowed
	before terminating.  Default = 5000.
    P0: Initial starting point, an Ndim element vector.  The starting
	point must be specified using either the keyword SIMPLEX, or P0 and
	SCALE.  P0 may be either single or double precision floating.
	For example, in a 3-dimensional problem, if the initial guess
	is the point [0,0,0], and it is known that the function's
	minimum value occurs in the interval: -10 &lt;
	X(0) &lt; 10, -100 &lt; X(1) &lt; 100, -200 &lt; X(2) &lt; 200, specify: P0=[0,0,0],
	SCALE=[10, 100, 200]. 
    SCALE: a scalar or Ndim element vector contaiing the problem's
	characteristic length scale for each dimension.
	SCALE is used with P0 to form an initial (Ndim+1) point simplex.
	If all dimensions have the same	scale, specify a scalar.
    SIMPLEX: (output and/or optional input) On input, if P0 and SCALE
	are not set, SIMPLEX contains the Ndim+1 vertices, each of
	Ndim elements, of starting simplex, in either single or double
	precision floating point, in an (Ndim, Ndim+1) array. On output,
	SIMPLEX contains the simplex, of dimensions (Ndim, Ndim+1), enclosing
	the function minimum.  The first point, Simplex(*,0), corresponds to
	the function's minimum.

 OUTPUTS:
   Result: If the minimum is found, an Ndim vector, corresponding to
	the Function's minimum value is returned.  If a function minimum
	within the given tolerance, is NOT found in the given number of
	evaluations, a scalar value of -1 is returned.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
	None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
	None.

 PROCEDURE:
	This procedure implements the Simplex method, described in
	Numerical Recipes, Section 10.4.  See also the POWELL procedure.

	Advantages:  requires only function evaluations, not
	derivatives, may be more reliable than the POWELL method.
	Disadvantages: not as efficient as Powell's method, and usually
	requires more function evaluations.

	Results are performed in the mode (single or double precision)
	returned by the user-supplied function.  The mode of the inputs P0,
	SCALE, or SIMPLEX, should match that returned by the function. The
	mode of the input vector supplied to the user-written function, is
	determined by P0, SCALE, or SIMPLEX.

 EXAMPLE:
	Use Amoeba to find the slope and intercept of a straight line fitting
	a given set of points minimizing the maximum error:

	The function to be minimized returns the maximum error,
	given p(0) = intercept, and p(1) = slope:
 FUNCTION FUNC, p
 COMMON FUNC_XY, x, y
 RETURN, MAX(ABS(y - (p(0) + p(1) * x)))
 END

	Put the data points into a common block so they are accessible to the
	function: 
 COMMON FUNC_XY, x, y
	Define the data points:
   x = findgen(17)*5
   y = [ 12.0,  24.3,  39.6,  51.0,  66.5,  78.4,  92.7, 107.8, 120.0, $
        135.5, 147.5, 161.0, 175.4, 187.4, 202.5, 215.4, 229.9]

	Call the function.  Fractional tolerance = 1 part in 10^5, 
	Initial guess = [0,0], and the minimum should be found within
	a distance of 100 of that point: 
   r = AMOEBA(1.0e-5, SCALE=1.0e2, P0 = [0, 0], FUNCTION_VALUE=fval)

	Check for convergence:
   if n_elements(r) eq 1 then message,'AMOEBA failed to converge'
	Print results.
   print, 'Intercept, Slope:', r, 'Function value (max error): ', fval(0)
Intercept, Slope:      11.4100      2.72800
Function value:       1.33000
