Procedure:
  thm_part_slice2d

Purpose:
   Wrapper for using spd_slice2d to create particle distribution contours.
   This essentially performs all THEMIS-specific operations that occured
   in the original thm_part_slice2d and should be backward-compatible.
   
   Returns a 2-D slice of THEMIS ESA/SST particle distributions.
   This procedure works in conjunction with thm_part_dist_array.pro and 
   thm_part_slice2d_plot.pro.

   There are three methods for generating slices:

   Geomtric:
     Each point on the plot is given the value of the bin it instersects.
     This allows bin boundaries to be drawn at high resolutions.

   2D Interpolation:
     Datapoints within the specified theta or z-axis range are projected onto 
     the slice plane and linearly interpolated onto a regular 2D grid. 

   3D Interpolation:
     The entire 3-dimensional distribution is linearly interpolated onto a 
     regular 3d grid and a slice is extracted from the volume.

    
Calling Sequence:
    thm_part_slice2d, datArr, [datArr2, [datArr3, [datArr4]]], $
                      timewin = timewin, slice_time=slice_time, $
                      part_slice=part_slice


Arguments:
 DATARR[#]: An array of pointers to 3D data structures.
            See thm_part_dist_array.pro for more.
 
 
Keywords:

 SLICE_TIME: Beginning of time window in seconds since Jan. 1, 1970.  If
             CENTER_TIME keyword set, then TIME is the center of the time widow
             specified by the TIMEWIN keyword.
 TIMEWIN: Length in seconds over which to compute the slice.
 CENTER_TIME: Flag that, when set, centers the time window around the time 
              specified by SLICE_TIME keyword. 
 UNITS: A string specifying the units to be used.
        ('counts', 'DF' (default), 'rate', 'crate', 'flux', 'eflux')
 ENERGY: Flag to plot data against energy (in eV) instead of velocity.
 LOG: Flag to apply logarithmic scaling to the radial mesure (i.e. energy/velocity).
      (on by default if /ENERGY is set)
        
 TWO_D_INTERP: Flag to use 2D interpolation method (described above)
 THREE_D_INTERP: Flag to use 3D interpolation method (described above)
 
 COORD: A string designating the coordinate system in which the slice will be 
        oriented.  Options are 'DSL', 'GSM', 'GSE' and the following magnetic
        field aligned coordinates (field parallel to z axis).
        
      'xgse':  The x axis is the projection of the GSE x-axis
      'ygsm':  The y axis is the projection of the GSM y-axis
      'zdsl':  The y axis is the projection of the DSL z-axis
      'RGeo':  The x is the projection of radial spacecraft position vector (GEI)
      'mRGeo':  The x axis is the projection of the negative radial spacecraft position vector (GEI)
      'phiGeo':  The y axis is the projection of the azimuthal spacecraft position vector (GEI), positive eastward
      'mphiGeo':  The y axis is the projection of the azimuthal spacecraft position vector (GEI), positive westward
      'phiSM':  The y axis is the projection of the azimuthal spacecraft position vector in Solar Magnetic coords
      'mphiSM':  The y axis is the projection of the negative azimuthal spacecraft position vector in Solar Magnetic coords

        
 ROTATION: The rotation keyword specifies the orientation of the slice plane 
           within the given coordinates (BV and BE will be invariant between
           coordinate systems).
       
     'BV':  The x axis is parallel to B field; the bulk velocity defines the x-y plane
     'BE':  The x axis is parallel to B field; the B x V(bulk) vector defines the x-y plane
     'xy':  (default) The x axis is along the coordinate's x axis and y is along the coordinate's y axis
     'xz':  The x axis is along the coordinate's x axis and y is along the coordinate's z axis
     'yz':  The x axis is along the coordinate's y axis and y is along the coordinate's z axis
     'xvel':  The x axis is along the coordinate's x axis; the x-y plane is defined by the bulk velocity 
     'perp':  The x axis is the bulk velocity projected onto the plane normal to the B field; y is B x V(bulk)
     'perp_xy':  The coordinate's x &amp; y axes are projected onto the plane normal to the B field
     'perp_xz':  The coordinate's x &amp; z axes are projected onto the plane normal to the B field
     'perp_yz':  The coordinate's y &amp; z axes are projected onto the plane normal to the B field
     

 SLICE_X/SLICE_NORM: These keywords respectively specify the slice plane's 
               x-axis and normal within the coordinates specified by 
               COORD and ROTATION. Both keywords take 3-vectors as input.
               
               If SLICE_X is not specified then the given coordinate's 
               x-axis will be used. If SLICE_X is not perpendicular to 
               the normal it's projection onto the slice plane will be used.
               An error will be thrown if no projection exists.
               
               If SLICE_NORM is not specified then the given coordinate's
               z-axis will be used (slice along by x-y plane in those 
               coordinates).
                 
       examples:
         Slice plane perpendicular to DSL z-axis using [3,2,0] as plane's x-axis: 
         (this is the same as only using SLICE_X=[3,2,1])
           COORD='dsl' (default), ROTATION='xyz' (default), SLICE_X=[3,2,1]
         
         Slice plane perp. to GSE x-axis, bulk velocity used to define plane's x-axis:
           COORD='gse', ROTATION='xvel', SLICE_NORM=[1,0,0], SLICE_X=[0,1,0]

         Slice plane along the B field and radial position vectors, B field used as slice's x-axis:
           COORD='rgeo', SLICE_NORM=[0,1,0], SLICE_X=[0,0,1]
 DISPLACEMENT: Vector. New center of the coordinate system.
       example:
         Slice at the point x=0.5, y = 0.5 and z=0.1.
         DISPLACEMENT = [0.5, 0.5. 0.1]
         
    
 VEL_DATA: Name of tplot variable containing the bulk velocity data.
           This will be used for slice plane alignment and subtraction.
           If not set the bulk velocity will be automatically calculated
           from the distribution (when needed).
 MAG_DATA: Name of tplot variable containing magnetic field data.
           This will be used for slice plane alignment.
 ERANGE: Two element array specifying the energy range to be used.
 COUNT_THRESHOLD: Mask bins that fall below this number of counts after averaging.
                (e.g. COUNT_THRESHOLD=1 masks bins with counts below 1)
 RESOLUTION: Integer specifying the resolution along each dimension of the
             slice (defaults:  2D/3D interpolation: 150, geometric: 500) 
 SMOOTH: An odd integer &gt;=3 specifying the width of the smoothing window in # 
         of points. Even entries will be incremented, 0 and 1 are ignored.
         Smoothing is performed with a gaussian convolution.

 THETARANGE: (2D interpolation only)
             Angle range, in degrees [-90,90], used to calculate slice.
             Default = [-20,20]; will override ZDIRRANGE. 
 ZDIRRANGE: (2D interpolation only)
            Z-Axis range, in km/s, used to calculate slice.
            Ignored if called with THETARANGE.

 AVERAGE_ANGLE: (geometric only)
                Two element array specifying an angle range over which 
                averaging will be applied. The angle is measured 
                from the slice plane and about the slice's x-axis; 
                positive in the right handed direction. This will
                average over all data within that range.
                    e.g. [-25,25] will average data within 25 degrees
                         of the slice plane about it's x-axis

 MSG_OBJ: Object reference to GUI message bar. If included useful
          console messages will also be output to GUI.

       }
 


NOTES:
   - Regions containting no data are assigned zeros instead of NaNs.
   - Interpolation may occur across data gaps or areas with recorded zeroes
     when using 3D interpolation (use geometric interpolation to see bins).
   - The center/midpoint time of a distribution is used as it's timestamp
     when determining it's inclusion in the requested time range.  The full
     time range of all included samples is stored in the metadata.
