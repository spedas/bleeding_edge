PROCEDURE: thm_part_getspec
PURPOSE:
	Generates tplot variables containing energy-time angular particle spectra
	for any angle range and/or any energy range.

KEYWORDS:
 probe  = Probe name. The default is 'all', i.e., load all available probes.
          This can be an array of strings, e.g., ['a', 'b'] or a
          single string delimited by spaces, e.g., 'a b'
 trange = (Optional) Time range of interest  (2 element array), if
          this is not set, the default is to prompt the user. Note
          that if the input time range is not a full day, a full
          day's data is loaded.
 phi    = Angle range of interest (2 element array) in degrees relative to
          probe-sun direction in the probe's spin plane. Specify angles in
          ascending order (e.g. [90, 180]) to specify the 'daylight'
          hemisphere in DSL coordinates. Default is all 360 degrees (e.g.
          [0, 360]). If the phi range is greater than 360 degrees, then the phi
          bins at the beginning of the phi range are added and wrapped around
          the end of phi range. For example, if phi=[-90,360], the phi bins
          corresponding to 270-360 degrees are appended to the bottom of the plot.
          Also controls which bins are selected for
          pitch/gyrovelocity spectra. Phi is limited to be between -360
          and 720 degrees. Note that, if the ENERGY keyword is set (as
          is true in the default case). This is also true for 'pa'
          and 'gyro' cases.
 theta  = Angle range of interest (2 element array) in degrees relative to
          spin plane, e.g. [-90, 0] or [-45, 45] in the probe's spin plane.
          Specify in acending order. Default is all (e.g. [-90, 90]). Also
          controls which bins are selected for pitch/gyrovelocity spectra.
 pitch  = Angle range of interest (2 element array) in degrees relative to
          the magnetic field. Default is all (e.g. [0, 180]). Has no effect
          on phi/theta spectra plots.
 gyro   = Gyrovelocity angle range of interest (2 element array) in degrees.
          Same rules as specifying phi apply to gyrophse. Default is all
          (e.g. [0, 360]). Has no effect on phi/theta spectra plots.
 erange = Energy range (in eV) of interest (2 element array). Default is all.
 data_type = The type of data to be loaded (e.g. ['peif', 'peef'])
 start_angle = Angle at which to begin plotting the data the bottom of the
               plot along the y-axis. At this time this works for phi only. If
               not set, keyword defaults to first element of phi input.
 suffix = Suffix to add to tplot variable names.
 /AUTOPLOT: Set to activiate a simple plotting routine to display tplot
            variables created by this routine.
 /ENERGY: Set to output tplot variables containing the energy spectrum of the
          energy/angle ranges input above.
 angle  = Type of angular spectrum tplot variable created and plotted using the
          energy/angle ranges input above e.g. 'phi'. Default is 'phi'. The
          type of angular spectra is appended to its corresponding tplot
          variable name. All possible options are:
          phi   = phi angular spectrum
          theta = theta angular spectrum
          pa    = pitch angular spectrum (only works with full angle ranges)
          gyro  = gyrovelocity angular spectrum  (only works with full angle
                  ranges)
          NOTE: If neither of ENERGY and ANGLE keywords are specified, then
                then both are turned on with ANGLE defaulting to 'phi'.
 /GET_SUPPORT_DATA: load support_data variables as well as data variables into
                    tplot variables.
 regrid = [m,n]  Number of angle bins, used to re-grid (2-element array) along
          phi (gyrovelocity) and theta (pitch), respectively, when calculating
          pitch/gyrovelocity angle spectrum. For example, e.g. [32,16] creates
          a regularly-spaced array of 32 phi angles by 16 theta angles that
          resample the probe(s) native angle bin array. Default is [16,8].
          Keyword has no effect on phi and theta spectragrams. Accuracy of the
          spectragrams increases when more angle bins are used to re-grid.
          Suitable numbers for m and n are numbers like 2^k. So far, k=2-6 has
          been tested and work. Other numbers will work provided 180/n and
          360/m are rational.
 other_dim = Keyword passed to THM_FAC_MATRIX_MAKE for conversion to field
             aligned coordinates to create pitch angle and gyrovelocity
             spectra. See THM_FAC_MATRIX_MAKE for valid input. Default is
             'mphigeo'.
 /NORMALIZE: Set to normalize the flux for each time sample to 0-1.
 badbins2mask = A 0-1 array that indicates which SST bins will be masked with
                NaN to eliminate things like sun contamination. The array
                should have the same number of elements as the number of angle
                bins for a given data type. A 0 indicates that will be masked
                with a NaN. This is basically the output from the bins argument
                of EDIT3DBINS.
 datagap = Maximum time gap in seconds over which to interpolate the plot.
           Sets the DATAGAP flag in the dlimits which SPECPLOT uses to
           interpolate pixels in time gaps less than DATAGAP.  Use this keyword
           when overlaying spectra plots, allowing the underlying spectra to be
           shown in the data gaps of the overlying spectra.  Default is zero.
 fractional_counts = Flag to keep the ESA unit conversion routine from rounding 
                     to an even number of counts when removing the dead time 
                     correction (no effect if input data already in counts, 
                     no effect on SST data).

  dist_array:  Provide an array of data instead of having thm_part_getspec/thm_part_moments2 load the data directly.
    This allows preprocessing/sanitization operations to be performed prior to moment generation.
    See thm_part_dist_array.pro, thm_part_conv_units.pro    

           
ESA PEER/PEIR/PEIF Background Removal Keywords:

/bdnd_remove:  Turn on ESA background removal.

bgnd_type(Default 'anode'): Set to string naming background removal type:
'angle','omni', or 'anode'.

bgnd_npoints(Default = 3): Set to the number of lowest values points to average over when determining background.
              
bgnd_scale(Default=1): Set to a scaling factor that the background will be multiplied by before it is subtracted

GUI-RELATED KEYWORDS:
 /GUI_FLAG: Flag tells code to recognize status bar and history window objects.
 gui_statusBar = Object reference to status bar object in GUI.
 gui_historyWin = Object reference to history window object in GUI.
 
EXAMPLE: thm_part_getspec, probe='d', trange=['07-06-17','07-06-19']

BACKGROUND REMOVAL(BGND) Description, Warnings and Caveats(from Vassilis Angelopoulos):
 This code allows for keywords that permit omni-directional or anode-dependent
 background removal from penetrating electrons in the ESA ion and electron 
 detectors. Anode-dependent subtraction is used when possible by default,
 i.e., when angle information is available; but user has full control by
 keyword specification. Default bgnd estimates use 3 lowest counts/s values.
 Scaling of the background (artificial scaling) can also allow playing with
 background estimates to account for noise statistics in the background itself.
 The parameters that have worked well for me during high bgnd levels are:
 ,/bgnd_remove, bgnd_type='anode', bgnd_npoints=3, bgnd_scale=1.5

 The same keywords when used in thm_part_getspec, and thm_part_moments
 are understood and passed to the data extraction routines, such that 
 they will do the removal before computing moments or spectra.

 This background subtraction to be used at the inner magnetosphere,
 or when SST electron fluxes indicate presence of significant electron
 fluxes at the satellite (injections). At quiet times the code tends to remove
 real fluxes, so beware.

HELPER Function. (Main routine below)

Purpose: Checks returnd error messages from underlying routines
         against previously returned messages. If the message 
         is new it will be printed and added to the stored 
         message array.
         
         This should allow messages generated within the loop 
         over time to be printed once instead of hundreds or  
         thousands of times.


Usage: thm_part_moments2_msg, msg_ball, msg, dlevel=1

Arguments:
       msg_ball: string array of all previously printed messages
       msg: string or string array of newly returned message(s)

Keywords:
       dlevel: Not a formal keyword, but passed through _extra

Notes: This routine assumes it will get correct input, 
       please do not disappoint it.

PROCEDURE: thm_part_sphere_interpolate
PURPOSE:  Interpolate particle data to match the look direcitons of another distribution

INPUTS:
  source: A particle dist_data structure to be modified by interpolation to match target
  target: A particle dist_data structure whose look directions will be matched
  
OUTPUTS:
   Replaces source with a spherically interpolated target

KEYWORDS: 
  error: Set to 1 on error, zero otherwise
  
 NOTES:
   #1 Interpolation done using IDL library routine &quot;griddata&quot;
   
   #2 This code assumes that source &amp; target have been time interpolated to match each other 
   
   This has a ton of TBDs, we need to come back and fix them when time is available.  With TBDs this code will not have general purpose utility...
