                varname_out = varname_out, $

                valid_names = valid_names,$
                suffix=suffix
                
Purpose:
  Loads Solar and Lunar Ephemeris data from a CDF.  
  
  1. Data is generated using the JPL SPICE/ICY library.  Extensive documentation
  can be found on the SPICE/ICY website:
  http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/IDL/req/index.html
  
  2. All quantities are in GEI coordinates. GEI Epoch is True of Date(this 
  is the THEMIS standard).
  
  3. All data have abberational corrections for light time and stellar abberation.
  Thus the data represent the state of the Moon and the Sun as they would be
  observed on earth at a particular time. A more detailed discussion of this topic 
  can be found in the SPICE/ICY 'SPK' required reading document. The SPICE/ICY 
  abberation used is called 'LT+S'.
  
  4. GEI True of Date are not built into SPICE/ICY.  A custom kernel is used when
  generating these data that accounts for earth precession using the IAU_1976 
  precessional model and accounts for earth nutation using the IAU_1980 nutational
  model which are built into SPICE/ICY.
  
  The quantities returned and their descriptions follow.
  
  1. slp_sun_pos:    Sun position X,Y,Z in km.
    
  2. slp_sun_vel:    Sun velocity X,Y,Z in km/sec.
  
  3. slp_sun_att_x:  IAU_SUN coordinate system X-axis(X,Y,Z).  (unitless/normalized)
                     A. This axis lies in the Solar equatorial plane and the plane containing the Solar prime meridian   
                     B. This axis points towards a fixed point on the solar surface and rotates with the sun.
                     C. This axis rotates with sidereal rotation period of the sun.~24.47 days.
                     D. This quantity created by rotation the basis vector [1,0,0] from IAU_SUN
                     into GEI coordinate orientation. 
                     E.  While this quantity is oriented relative to the GEI coordinate system, it is not technically earth centered.  Only
                     the rotational component of the transformation is performed, not the translation into earth-center.      
                     F.  slp_sun_att_z and slp_sun_att_x are orthognal axes, thus
                     slp_sun_att_y = slp_sun_att_z x slp_sun_att_x, and this set of axes can be used to 
                     transform between GEI and IAU_SUN coordinates 
                    
  4. slp_sun_att_z:  IAU_SUN coordinate system Z-axis(X,Y,Z). (unitless/normalized)
                     A.  This axis points in the direction of the mean rotational axis of the sun.
                     B. This quantity created by rotation the basis vector [0,0,1] from IAU_SUN
                     into GEI coordinate orientation. 
                     C. While this quantity is oriented relative to the GEI coordinate system, it is not technically earth centered.  Only
                     the rotational component of the transformation is performed, not the translation into earth-center.     
                     D.  slp_sun_att_z and slp_sun_att_x are orthognal axes, thus
                     slp_sun_att_y = slp_sun_att_z x slp_sun_att_x, and this set of axes can be used to 
                     transform between GEI and IAU_SUN coordinates 
                      
  5. slp_sun_ltime:  The time, in seconds, it takes for light to travel from the sun to the earth at the time of observation..
                     To translate data from light corrected to uncorrected data subtract these corrections from the data times.
                    
  6. slp_lun_pos:    Lunar position X,Y,Z in km.
  
  7. slp_lun_pos:    Lunar velocity X,Y,Z in km/s.
  
  8. slp_lun_att_x:  IAU_MOON coordinate system X-axis (X,Y,Z)
                     A.  This axis lies in the Lunar equatorial plane and the plane containing the Lunar prime meridian
                     B.  This axis points towards a fixed point on the moon's surface and rotates with the moon.
                     C.  This quantity created by rotation the basis vector [0,0,1] from IAU_MOON
                     into GEI coordinate orientation..  
                     D.  While this quantity is oriented relative to the GEI coordinate system, it is not technically earth centered.  Only
                     the rotational component of the transformation is performed, not the translation into earth-center. 
                     E.  slp_lun_att_z and slp_lun_att_x are orthognal axes, thus
                     slp_lun_att_y = slp_lun_att_z x slp_lun_att_x, and this set of axes can be used to 
                     transform between GEI and IAU_SUN coordinates 
  9. slp_lun_att_z:  IAU_MOON coordinate system Z-axis(X,Y,Z). (unitless/normalized)
                     A.  This axis points in the direction of the mean rotational axis of the moon.
                     B.  This quantity created by rotation the basis vector [0,0,1] from IAU_MOON
                     into GEI coordinates. 
                     C. While This quantity is in GEI coordinates, it is not technically earth centered.  Only
                     the rotational component of the transformation is performed, not the translation into earth-center.   
                     D.  slp_lun_att_z and slp_;un_att_x are orthognal axes, thus
                     slp_lun_att_y = slp_lun_att_z x slp_lun_att_x, and this set of axes can be used to 
                     transform between GEI and IAU_MOON coordinates. 
 10. slp_lun_ltime:  The time, in seconds, it takes for light to travel from the moon to the earth at the time of observation.
                     To translate data from light corrected to uncorrected data subtract these corrections from the data times.

  Delete th?_spin* TPLOT variables after calling THM_LOAD_SPIN (as long as
    ~/KEEP_SPIN_DATA), add KEEP_SPIN_DATA kw, include a couple of (normally
    commented) lines to chck consistency of spinmodel, WMF, 4/10/08.

 coordinate systems of returned variables:
 *_pos : gei
 *_vel : gei
 *_ras : gei

NAME:
thm_load_state_relpath
PURPOSE:
Alternate relpathname routine for L1 state data, allows for different
relpath from SPDF directory with v0? in the final relpathname
CALLING SEQUENCE:
relpathnames = thm_load_state_relpath(sname = sname, filetype =
                                      filetype, level = level, $
                                      version = version, $
                                      trange = trange, $
                                      addmaster = addmaster)
INPUT:
 sname = probe, one of ['a','b','c','d','e']
 filetype = 'state' -&gt; this keyword is only defined here due to the
            interface to thm_load_xxx
 level = 'l1'  -&gt; this keyword is only defined here due to the
            interface to thm_load_xxx
 version = '0','1','2','3' or '?' The default is to not have a
           version number, and this keyword is not used
 trange = the timerange
 relpathnames_local = the fullpath of the file as it will be saved
                      locally, this is an output keyword
OUTPUT:
 relpathnames = the full path of the files relative to the local
                and remote data directories.

NAME:
  thm_spin_phase
Purpose:
  Use sunpulse data produced by thm_sunpulse to get spinphase at abitrary times
Input Parameters:
      time_dat: double precision array: times of data points at which
                interpolates are desired.
Output Parameters:
   spinpha_int: interpolated spin phase
Keywords:
         Probe: a single probe name. e.g. 'a'
        suffix: suffix on tplot variable (thx_state_sunpulse[_suffix])

Optional Input Parameters (If not present, then state data will be
   loaded from standard state tplot variables, using probe keyword)
      sunpulse: double precision array: times of sunpulses
  sunp_spinper: spin period at each sunpulse time

NAME:
  thm_sunpulse
Purpose: 
  Interpolate spin phase to have same time resolution as time_dat
Keyword:
         probe: string indicating probe.  Array of strings, or a string
                like 'a b'.  Not used if positional parameters are present.
        suffix: suffix to add to default tplot name in which to store sunpulse
                data: thx_state_sunpulse (x = probe letter designation)
                This suffix is expected on the names of the state data inputs.
Optional Inputs/Output parameters:
(if not present, then standard state tplot variable names will be used for i/o)
  Input Parameters:
    time_state: double precision array: times of data from state file
       spinpha: spin phase from state file
       spinper: spin period from state file
  Output Parameters:
      sunpulse: sunpulse times (times of zero spin phase)
  sunp_spinper: spin period at time of each sunpulse.

Keywords:
 sunpulse_name: string.  If present, store sunpulse/spinperiod in tplot 
                variable with this name.  Has no effect if probe keyword 
                is provided.
