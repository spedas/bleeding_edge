 SECS load data crib sheet
 
 SECS (Spherical Elementary Currents) data has two data types
 EICS (Equivalent Ionospheric Currents) are the horizontal currents and
 SECA (SEC Amplitudes) are the current amplitudes
 
 Data resolution is 1 minute. Note: Datasets are large. It's recommended smaller time
 ranges be used
 
 The ground based magnetometer stations used to derive the data are available for some dates. 
 
 The SECS archive is created and maintained by James Weygand
 
 All data are available at  http://vmo.igpp.ucla.edu 

 do you have suggestions for this crib sheet?
   please send them to clrussell@igpp.ucla.edu
