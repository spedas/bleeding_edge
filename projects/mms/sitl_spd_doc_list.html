 NAME:
   fpi_quick

 PURPOSE:
   This is an emergency script to be used when EVA is not working but
   a FPI member still needs to submit a selection within a limited time.
   There won't be any display (because it won't generate any tplot-variable).

 INPUT: 
    START: (string) start time of the desired segment.
    STOP: (string) stop time of the desired segment.
    FOM: (long) the desired FOM value of the segment
