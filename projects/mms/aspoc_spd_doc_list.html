 PROCEDURE:
         mms_load_aspoc
         
 PURPOSE:
         Load data from the Active Spacecraft Potential Control (ASPOC)
 
 KEYWORDS:
         trange:       time range of interest [starttime, endtime] with the format
                       ['YYYY-MM-DD','YYYY-MM-DD'] or to specify more or less than a day
                       ['YYYY-MM-DD/hh:mm:ss','YYYY-MM-DD/hh:mm:ss']
         probes:       list of probes, valid values for MMS probes are ['1','2','3','4'].
                       if no probe is specified the default is probe '1'
         level:        indicates level of data processing. levels include ['l1b', 'l2', 'ql',
                       'sitl']. The default when no level is specified is 'l2' for data type 
                       'aspoc' and 'l1b' for all others.
         datatype:     data types include ['asp1', 'asp2', 'aspoc'].
                       If no value is given the default is 'aspoc'.
         data_rate:    instrument data rates include ['srvy', 'sitl']. The default is 'srvy'.
                       Note only 'srvy' is available for 'aspoc' data type. 
         local_data_dir: local directory to store the CDF files; should be set if
                       you're on *nix or OSX, the default currently assumes Windows (c:\data\mms\)
         source:       specifies a different system variable. By default the MMS mission system 
                       variable is !mms
         get_support_data: load support data (defined by support_data attribute in the CDF)
         tplotnames:   names for tplot variables
         no_color_setup: don't setup graphics configuration; use this keyword when you're 
                       using this load routine from a terminal without an X server running
                       do not set colors
         time_clip:    clip the data to the requested time range; note that if you do not use 
                       this keyword you may load a longer time range than requested
         no_update:    set this flag to preserve the original data. if not set and newer data is 
                       found the existing data will be overwritten
         varformat:    should be a string (wildcards accepted) that will match the CDF variables
                       that should be loaded into tplot variables
         cdf_filenames:  this keyword returns the names of the CDF files used when loading the data
         cdf_version:  specify a specific CDF version # to load (e.g., cdf_version='4.3.0')
         latest_version: only grab the latest CDF version in the requested time interval
                       (e.g., /latest_version)
         major_version: only open the latest major CDF version (e.g., X in vX.Y.Z) in the requested time interval
         min_version:  specify a minimum CDF version # to load
         spdf:         grab the data from the SPDF instead of the LASP SDC (only works for public access)
         available:    returns a list of files available at the SDC for the requested parameters
                       this is useful for finding which files would be downloaded (along with their sizes) if
                       you didn't specify this keyword (also outputs total download size)
         versions: this keyword returns the version #s of the CDF files used when loading the data
         always_prompt: set this keyword to always prompt for the user's username and password;
                       useful if you accidently save an incorrect password, or if your SDC password has changed
         tt2000: flag for preserving TT2000 timestamps found in CDF files (note that many routines in
                       SPEDAS (e.g., tplot.pro) do not currently support these timestamps)
 
 OUTPUT:
 
 
 EXAMPLE:
     See mms_load_aspoc_crib.pro for usage details.
 
     load L2 data for MMS 1 for aspoc1 
     MMS&gt; mms_load_aspoc, trange=['2015-07-15', '2015-07-16'], level='l2', probe=1
 
 NOTES:
    The MMS plug-in in SPEDAS requires IDL 8.4 to access data at the LASP SDC
