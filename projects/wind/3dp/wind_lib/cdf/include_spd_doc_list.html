 NAME:
       cdf.pro

 PURPOSE:
       `cdf.pro' is used to create a set of local variables containing the
       general constants used by the CDF library.  The CDF status codes are
       defined by `cdf1.pro' and the CDF Internal Interface constants are
       defined by `cdf2.pro'.

       This include file is part of the CDF interface provided with the CDF
       distribution.  IDL also provides its own built-in interface to CDFs.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       IDL&gt; @cdf.pro

 RESTRICTIONS:
       The use of `cdf.pro' may result in too many local variables being
       created.  If that occurs, consider using `cdf0x.pro' instead.

 REVISION HISTORY:
       26-Jun-95        Original version.

 NAME:
       cdf0.pro

 PURPOSE:
       `cdf0.pro' is used to create a set of structure variables containing
       the constants used by the CDF library.  The structures created and
       their contents are as follows...

               CDFconst     - General CDF constants.
               CDFdataType  - Data type codes.
               CDFencoding  - Encoding codes.
               CDFdecoding  - Decoding codes.
               CDFiCode     - Informational status codes.
               CDFwCode     - Warning status codes.
               CDFeCode     - Error status codes.
               CDFiiFnc     - Internal Interface functions.
               CDFiiItem    - General Internal Interface items.
               CDFiiItemA   - Internal Interface attribute items.
               CDFiiItemE   - Internal Interface entry items.
               CDFiiItemR   - Internal Interface rVariable items.
               CDFiiItemZ   - Internal Interface zVariable items.

       These structures contain the same values defined using the `cdf.pro',
       `cdf1.pro', and `cdf2.pro' batch files.  To see the contents of each
       structure, use the command...

               IDL&gt; help, /structure, &lt;structure-name&gt;

       The use of these structures eliminates the problem of too many local
       variables caused by the use of `cdf.pro', `cdf1.pro', and `cdf2.pro'.

       This include file is part of the CDF interface provided with the CDF
       distribution.  IDL also provides its own built-in interface to CDFs.

       If the lengths of these structure names are longer than desired,
       consider using `cdf0x.pro' instead.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       IDL&gt; @cdf0.pro

 EXAMPLE:
       IDL&gt; @cdf0.pro
       IDL&gt; status = CDFlib (CDFiiFnc.OPEN_, CDFiiItem.CDF_, 'rain2x', id, $
       IDL&gt;                  CDFiiFnc.NULL_)
       IDL&gt; if (status lt CDFconst.CDF_WARN) print, 'CDF not opened...'

 RESTRICTIONS:
       None.

 PURPOSE:
       `cdf0x.pro' is used to create a set of structure variables containing

               CDFen    - Encoding codes.
               CDFde    - Decoding codes.
               CDFic    - Informational status codes.
               CDFwc    - Warning status codes.
               CDFec    - Error status codes.
               CDFiif   - Internal Interface functions.
               CDFiix   - General Internal Interface items.
               CDFiia   - Internal Interface attribute items.
               CDFiie   - Internal Interface entry items.
               CDFiir   - Internal Interface rVariable items.
