Function:
  spd_slice2d


Purpose:
  Return an interpolated 2D slice of 3D particle data for plotting.


Interpolation Methods:

   3D Interpolation (default):
     The entire 3-dimensional distribution is linearly interpolated onto a 
     regular 3d grid and a slice is extracted from the volume.
     
   2D Interpolation:
     Datapoints within the specified theta or z-axis range are projected onto 
     the slice plane and linearly interpolated onto a regular 2D grid.      
    
   Geometric:
     Each point on the plot is given the value of the bin it intersects.
     This allows bin boundaries to be drawn at high resolutions.


Calling Sequence:
  
  slice = spd_slice2d( data [,data2 [,data3 [,data4]]] $
                       [,time=time [,window=window | samples=samples]]
                       [trange=trange] ... )


Example Usage:
  slice = spd_slice2d(data, time=time)            ;get slice from distribution closest to TIME
  slice = spd_slice2d(data, time=time, samples=4) ;use average of the 4 samples nearest to TIME
  slice = spd_slice2d(data, time=time, window=10) ;use average of all data within [TIME,TIME+10sec]
                                                  ;add &quot;/center_time&quot; for [TIME-5sec,TIME+5sec]  
  slice = spd_slice2d(data, trange=trange)        ;use average of all data within TRANGE

  slice = spd_slice2d(data, time=time, /three_d_interp) ;use 3D interpolation (default) 
  slice = spd_slice2d(data, time=time, /two_d_interp)   ;use 2D interpolation
  slice = spd_slice2d(data, time=time, /geometric)      ;use geometric interpolation

  See crib sheets:  
    THEMIS:  thm_crib_part_slice2d  (called by thm_part_slice2d)
    MMS:     mms_slice2d_fpi_crib
             mms_slice2d_hpca_crib
    

Arguments:
  DATARR[#]: An array of pointers to 3D data structures.
            See spd_dist_array.pro for more.
 
 
Basic Keywords:
  TRANGE: Two-element time range over which data will be averaged. (string or double)
  TIME: Time at which the slice will be computed. (string or double)
    SAMPLES: Number of nearest samples to TIME to average. (int/double)
             If neither SAMPLES nor WINDOW are specified then default=1.
    WINDOW: Length in seconds from TIME over which data will be averaged. (int/double)  
      CENTER_TIME: Flag denoting that TIME should be midpoint for window instead of beginning.
      
    SUM_SAMPLES: Flag denoting that the data should be summed over the requested trange rather than averaged
  
  THREE_D_INTERP: Flag to use 3D interpolation method (described above)      
  TWO_D_INTERP: Flag to use 2D interpolation method (described above)
  GEOMETRIC: Flag to use geometric interpolation method (described above)
 

Orientation Keywords:
  CUSTOM_ROTATION: Applies a custom rotation matrix to the data.  Input may be a
                   3x3 rotation matrix or a tplot variable containing matrices.
                   If the time window covers multiple matrices they will be averaged.
                   This is applied before other transformations
  ROTATION: Aligns the data relative to the magnetic field and/or bulk velocity.
            This is applied after the CUSTOM_ROTATION. (BV and BE are invariant 
            between coordinate systems)

            Use MAG_DATA keyword to specify magnetic field vector.
            Use VEL_DATA keyword to specify bulk velocity (optional).
       
     'BV':  The x axis is parallel to B field; the bulk velocity defines the x-y plane
     'BE':  The x axis is parallel to B field; the B x V(bulk) vector defines the x-y plane
     'xy':  (default) The x axis is along the data's x axis and y is along the data's y axis
     'xz':  The x axis is along the data's x axis and y is along the data's z axis
     'yz':  The x axis is along the data's y axis and y is along the data's z axis
     'xvel':  The x axis is along the data's x axis; the x-y plane is defined by the bulk velocity 
     'perp':  The x axis is the bulk velocity projected onto the plane normal to the B field; y is B x V(bulk)
     'perp_xy':  The data's x &amp; y axes are projected onto the plane normal to the B field
     'perp_xz':  The data's x &amp; z axes are projected onto the plane normal to the B field
     'perp_yz':  The data's y &amp; z axes are projected onto the plane normal to the B field
     
  SLICE_X &amp; SLICE_NORM: These keywords respectively specify the slice plane's 
                        x-axis and normal within the coordinates specified by  
                        CUSTOM_ROTATION and ROTATION. Both keywords take 
                        3-vectors as input. (See note below)
                       
                        If SLICE_X is not specified then the given coordinate's 
                        x-axis will be used. If SLICE_X is not perpendicular to 
                        the normal it's projection onto the slice plane will be used.
                        An error will be thrown if no projection exists.
                        
                        If SLICE_NORM is not specified then the given coordinate's
                        z-axis will be used (slice along by x-y plane in those 
                        coordinates).
                 
       examples:
         Slice along the data's x-z plane: 
           ROTATION='xz' 
         
         Slice plane's x axis is GSM x and y is in the direction of the bulk velocity:
           CUSTOM_ROTATION='my_gsm_tvar', ROTATION='xvel'

         Slice is perpendicular to &quot;tvar1&quot; and x axis is defined by projection of &quot;tvar2&quot;
           SLICE_NORM='tvar1', SLICE_X='tvar2'
           
       NOTE: Update at 06/04/2018 - The SLICE_X &amp; SLICE_NORM are defined after CUSTOM_ROTATION
         but before the ROTATION.          
           
 DISPLACEMENT: Vector. New center of the coordinate system.
       example:
         Slice at the point x=0.5, y = 0.5 and z=0.1.
         DISPLACEMENT = [0.5, 0.5. 0.1]

  MAG_DATA: Name of tplot variable containing magnetic field data or 3-vector.
            This will be used for slice plane alignment and must be in the 
            same coordinates as the particle data.
  VEL_DATA: Name of tplot variable containing the bulk velocity data or 3-vector.
            This will be used for slice plane alignment and must be in the
            same coordinates as the particle data.
            If not set the bulk velocity will be automatically calculated
            from the distribution (when needed).


Other Keywords:
  RESOLUTION: Integer specifying the resolution along each dimension of the
              slice (defaults:  2D/3D interpolation: 150, geometric: 500) 
  SMOOTH: An odd integer &gt;=3 specifying the width of a smoothing window in # 
          of points.  Smoothing is applied to the final plot using a gaussian 
          convolution. Even entries will be incremented, 0 and 1 are ignored.

  ENERGY: Flag to plot data against energy (in eV) instead of velocity.
  LOG: Flag to apply logarithmic scaling to the radial measure (i.e. energy/velocity).
       (on by default if /ENERGY is set)

  ZDIRRANGE: (2D interpolation only)
             Z-Axis range, in km/s, used to calculate slice.
             Ignored if called with THETARANGE.

  AVERAGE_ANGLE: (geometric interpolation only)
                 Two element array specifying an angle range over which 
                 averaging will be applied. The angle is measured 
                 from the slice plane and about the slice's horizontal axis; 
                 positive in the right handed direction. This will
                 average over all data within that range. 
                 
                 Note: for the default rotation='xy', the angle is measured from the XY 
                 slice plane and about the x-axis
                    e.g. rotation='xy', average_angle=[-25,25] will average data within 25 degrees
                         of the XY slice plane about it's x-axis
                    or     
                         rotation='yz', average_angle=[-25,25] will average data within 25 degrees
                         of the YZ slice plane about it's y-axis

  SUM_ANGLE: (geometric interpolation only)
                 Two element array specifying an angle range over which 
                 summing will be applied. The angle is measured 
                 from the slice plane and about the slice's horizontal axis; 
                 positive in the right handed direction. This will
                 sum over all data within that range. 
                 
                 Note: for the default rotation='xy', the angle is measured from the XY 
                 slice plane and about the x-axis
                    e.g. rotation='xy', sum_angle=[-25,25] will sum data within 25 degrees
                         of the XY slice plane about it's x-axis
                    or     
                         rotation='yz', sum_angle=[-25,25] will sum data within 25 degrees
                         of the YZ slice plane about it's y-axis
               
  MSG_OBJ: Reference to dprint display object.
  
  DETERM_TOLERANCE:  tolerance of the determinant of the custom rotation matrix 
           (maximum acceptable difference from determ(C)=1 where C is the 
           user's custom rotation matrix); default is 1e-6

NOTES:
   - Regions containing no data are assigned zeros instead of NaNs.
   - Interpolation may occur across data gaps or areas with recorded zeroes
     when using 3D interpolation (use geometric interpolation to see bins).
   - The center/midpoint time of a distribution is used as it's timestamp
     when determining it's inclusion in the requested time range.  The full
     time range of all included samples is stored in the metadata.
