How to update your CDF and/or GEOPACK versions 

Important: Please contact your system administrator first.

To update the CDF (or GEOPACK) dlm files, 
you have to copy two files 
and paste them into your IDL directory, 
replacing any files with the same name. 
To accomplish this, you need the appropriate 
administrative permissions. 

===========================================
Follow these steps for CDF: 

1. Download and unzip the following zip file:
http://spedas.org/downloads/cdf_dlm.zip

2. CDF version 3.6.2
Locate and copy the two (or three for win64) files under: 
<unzip directory>/cdf_dlm/<your OS>/

3. Paste the above CDF dlm files into the appropriate 
IDL directory for DLM files. 
This directory is shown in the Help->About box.
This directory varies, depending on which IDL version 
you are using and how IDL was installed.
For example, for Windows the appropriate directory could be:  
C:\Program Files\Exelis\IDL85\bin\bin.x86_64
