This folder contains scripts that generate the figures for the MMS quicklook plots. These plots are generated throughout the mission, and can be located on the web at:

https://lasp.colorado.edu/mms/sdc/public/quicklook/ 

These scripts load and plot QL/L1b data (non-science quality), and require MMS team member access to the LASP SDC.

Users should use Quicklook data plots for event browsing, and not for scientific analysis or publication without express consent of the PI and relevant Lead Co-Investigators.
