 NAME: mms_bss_load

 PURPOSE: To return burst-segment status (aka 'back-structure') 
          within a given time interval. Ask super-SITLs for the meaning of 
          each tag in the returned structure.  
          
 CALLING SEQUENCE: result = mms_bss_load(trange)

 INPUTS:  trange .... can be either string or double

 EXAMPLE:

     MMS&gt; tr = time_double('2015-11-04/'+['04:00','05:00'])
     MMS&gt; s = mms_bss_load(trange=tr)
     MMS&gt; help, s
     
 NOTES: 
     
     1. If no burst-segment were found within the trange, then this function returns -1
     
     2. The timerange 'trange' should not be too big (like more than a month).
        because LaTis (at SDC) will return an erratic result (as of 2016-09-02).
     
     3. The FIN keyword is obsolete and should not be used if the above issue (item 2) 
        remains. 
        
   FIN: Set this keyword to find segments that 'finished' within trange
        instead of querying segments that were defined within trange.
        Because a segment can take many tens of days,
        trange is expand to [tlaunch,tnow] when retrieving segment info.

 NAME: mms_bss_query

 PURPOSE: 
     To query the back-structure. Somehow, the SDC code &quot;get_mms_burst_segment_status&quot;
     does not work well for querying by status. Here, the program loads the entire
     set of the back-structure (or you can limit it by 'trange') and then analyze
     the segments.
