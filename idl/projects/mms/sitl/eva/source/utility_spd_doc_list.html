 NAME:
  MMS_TEXTBOX 

 PURPOSE:

  This function allows the user to type some text in a
  pop-up dialog widget and have it returned to the program.
  This is an example of a Pop-Up Dialog Widget.

 CATEGORY:

  Utility, Widgets

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

  thetext = TextBox()

 INPUTS:

  None.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

  CANCEL: An output parameter. If the user kills the widget or clicks the Cancel
       button this keyword is set to 1. It is set to 0 otherwise. It
       allows you to determine if the user canceled the dialog without
       having to check the validity of the answer.

       theText = TextBox(Title='Provide Phone Number...', Label='Number:', Cancel=cancelled)
       IF cancelled THEN Return

  GROUP_LEADER: The widget ID of the group leader of this pop-up
       dialog. This should be provided if you are calling
       the program from within a widget program:

          thetext = TextBox(Group_Leader=event.top)

       If a group leader is not provided, an unmapped top-level base widget
       will be created as a group leader.

  LABEL: A string the appears to the left of the text box.

  TITLE:  The title of the top-level base. If not specified, the
       string 'Provide Input:' is used by default.

  VALUE: A string variable that is the intial value of the textbox. By default, a null string.

  XSIZE: The size of the text widget in pixel units. By default, 200.

 OUTPUTS:

  theText: The string of characters the user typed in the
       text widget. No error checking is done.

 RESTRICTIONS:

  The widget is destroyed if the user clicks on either button or
  if they hit a carriage return (CR) in the text widget. The
  text is recorded if the user hits the ACCEPT button or hits
  a CR in the text widget.

 NAME:
       ProgramRootDir

 PURPOSE:

       The purpose of this function is to provide a portable way of finding
       the root directory of a program distribution. The directory that is returned
       is the directory in which the source file using ProgramRootDir resides.
       The program is useful for distributing applications that have a large number
       of files in specific program directories.

 SYNTAX:

       theDirectory = ProgramRootDir()

 RETURN_VALUE:

       theDirectory:   The directory in which the program module running ProgramRootDir resides.

 ARGUMENTS:

       None.

 KEYWORDS:

       NOMARK: Normally, the directory that is returned contains a path separator at its
               end, so that the directory can easily be concatinated with other file names.
               If this keyword is set, the final path separator mark is removed from the
               directory name.

       ONEUP:  Set this keyword if you want to start your search one directory
               *above* where your source program resides (i.e., &quot;../Source&quot;).
               This allows you, for example, to put your source files in a Source
               directory that it at the same level as your Data directory, Utility
               directory, etc. See the example below.

       TWOUP:  Set this keyword if you want to start your search two directories
               *above* where your source program resides (i.e., &quot;../../Source&quot;).


 EXAMPLE:

       Assume that your application files (and source programs) reside in this root directory:

           ../app

       You have placed a DATA directory immediately under the APP directiory, and a RESOURCES
       directory immedately under the DATA directory. Your directory structure looks like this:

           ../app                    ; Contains your application and source (*.pro) files.
           ../app/data               ; Contains your application data files.
           ...app/data/resources     ; Contains your application resource files.

       The end user can install the APP directory wherever he or she likes. In your
       program, you will identify the DATA and RESOURCES directory like this:

            ; Get icon image in resources directory.
            filename = Filepath(Root_Dir=ProgramRootDir(), Subdirectory=['data','resources'], 'myicon.tif')

            ; Get default image in data directory.
            filename = Filepath(Root_Dir=ProgramRootDir(), Subdirectory='data', 'ctscan.tif')

       Alternatively, you might set up an application directory structure like this:

           ../app                    ; Contains your application files.
           ../app/source             ; Contains your application source (*.pro) files.
           ../app/data               ; Contains your application data files.
           ...app/data/resources     ; Contains your application resource files.

       In this case, you would use the ONEUP keyword to find your data and resource files, like this:

            ; Get icon image in resources directory.
            filename = Filepath(Root_Dir=ProgramRootDir(/ONEUP), Subdirectory=['data','resources'], 'myicon.tif')

            ; Get default image in data directory.
            filename = Filepath(Root_Dir=ProgramRootDir(/ONEUP), Subdirectory='data', 'ctscan.tif')
