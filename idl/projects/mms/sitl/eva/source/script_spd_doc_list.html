 NAME:
   EVA_CMD_LOAD

 PURPOSE:
   This is a command-line script for loading a set of parameters for SITL and/or EVA.
   By default, this program loads variables as configured in EVA's &quot;SITL_BASIC_DAYSIDE&quot;
   parameterSet from the latest ROI timerange. Use keywords for selecting another
   parameterSet or timerange.

 OUTPUT:
   a variety of tplot-variables as configured in the specified parameter-Set.

 KEYWORDS:
    PARAMSET: The name of your preferred parameter-set (as configured in EVA) 
              If not specified, the default is &quot;SITL_Basic_Dayside&quot;
    PROBES:   List of probes, valid values for MMS probes are ['1','2','3','4'].
              If no probe is specified the default is probe '3' (as it is in EVA)
    TRANGE:   time range of interest [starttime, endtime] with the format
              ['YYYY-MM-DD','YYYY-MM-DD'] or to specify more or less than a day
              ['YYYY-MM-DD/hh:mm:ss','YYYY-MM-DD/hh:mm:ss'] 
    TIMESPAN: Set this keyword if you would like to use the 'timespan' command
              before calling this program.
    PARAMLIST: A named variable that, if supplied, contains the list of 
               loaded tplot-variables.

 EXAMPLES:

  1. To load &quot;SITL_Quick&quot; parameters for MMS3 from the latest ROI
  
     MMS&gt; eva_cmd_load, paramset='SITL_Quick', probe='3'

  2. To load &quot;SITL_QUICK&quot; parameters for MMS3 from the ROI of 2016 January 7.
     Here, the 'mms_get_roi' command is used to get the exact time range of the ROI. 
  
     MMS&gt; eva_cmd_load, paramset='SITL_Quick', probe='3', trange=mms_get_roi('2016-01-07')

  3. Do the same thing as #2, but by using the 'timespan' command

     MMS&gt; timespan,'2016-01-07/20:40',13,/hours
     MMS&gt; eva_cmd_load, paramet='SITL_Quick', probe='3', /timespan

 NAME:
   EVA_FONT_TEST

 PURPOSE:
   Use this script when the dashboard in EVA's main control panel look corrupted
   or the font is missing. If you run this script and clicked the DRAW button,
   you should see a phrase &quot;325 buffers&quot;.

   If you do not see the phrase, then something is wrong in IDL. Please try re-booting
   your computer or re-installing IDL. 

   If you do see the phrase and the script seems working okay, there could be another
   problem in EVA. Please relaunch IDL, display some data using, say SITL_Quick. Then, 
   please send me everything you have in the IDL console.

 NAME:  eva_get_sitl_selections

 PURPOSE:
   To download SITL-selection files (max 10000 files) for a defined time period 
   and return those filenames. If the time period is not defined, 
   the latest file will be downloaded. The file timestamps can 
   also be returned (i.e., the time the SITL submitted the selections)

 CALLING SEQUENCE: filenames = eva_get_sitl_selections(trange=trange [, num] )

 INPUT:
    trange: (optional, either string or double)
       - The time range from which SITL selection files are searched.
       - The file stamps (i.e., the time the SITL submitted the
         selections) are used for the search. 
       - If omitted, the latest file will be searched.                     

 OUTPUT:
    filenames: a string array indicating the filenames of matched SITL-selections.

 OTHER OUTPUT:
    n         : the number of matched files.
    filetimes: the time stamps (i.e., the time the SITL submitted the
                selections) of matched files.

 NAME:
   EVA_SITL_RESTORE_TXT

 PURPOSE:
   This is a command-line script to be used when the SITL has a long list of
   burst-selections requested from non-SITL scientists. This script was developed
   during the commissioning phase when various instrument teams were requesting
   certain burst time periods for calibration purposes (&quot;Extended ROI&quot;).
   By using this script, the SITL could easily add those requested segments
   into EVA without the hassle of adding segments manually one-by-one.

 USAGE:

   1. Launch EVA and display automated FOM, as usual.
   2. From the IDL console, type in the command:  MMS&gt; eva_sitl_restore_txt
   3. A dialog appears for you to select a text file. There is a sample file at
      [YOUR_SPEDAS_DIRECTORY]/projects/mms/sitl/eva/source/script/eva_sitl_restore_txt_sample.txt
   4. Once you select a file, then the FOM-structure gets updated in EVA.

   The key point here is that we need to have the input file in a certain format.
   Please see the sample file above. No need to put a date for end-time (3rd column);
   If a segment was crossing mid-night, then the script will assume the day after
   the input date (See the 3rd line of the sample file).

   I still suggest checking each selection carefully after importing with this script.
   If you encounter an error, please check if there is any overlap in the selections.
