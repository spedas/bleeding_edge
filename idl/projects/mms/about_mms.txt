The MMS plug-in in SPEDAS requires IDL 8.4 to access data at the LASP SDC

1) See the following regarding rules for the use of MMS data:
	https://lasp.colorado.edu/mms/sdc/public/about/

2) CDF version 3.6.3+ is required to correctly handle leap seconds.  

3) The local paths will mirror the SDC directory structure

4) For data availability:
	https://lasp.colorado.edu/mms/sdc/

5) Logging into the SDC: 
           - If you have an internet connection, you'll be prompted for a username and password the 
           first time you use the MMS plugin. There's an option in the widget that allows you 
           to save your password in a save file on the local machine; if you select this option, 
           the login prompt will never come up again and your saved password will be used to 
           login to the SDC. This is insecure and should not be used if you use a common 
           password with other services. 
           
           - Use an empty username and password for public access to the data

           - If you don't have an internet connection or you can't login remotely, the plugin will 
           look for the files on the local machine using a directory structure that matches 
           the directory structure at the SDC.
