Important


Purpose:
 Calculates ion and electron moments from full distribution
 this is a cut and paste crib, not to be run as program

 This crib is divided into three sections:
   1) the first section demonstrates a wrapper routine (thm_esa_specmom_calc.pro) 
      that gets L0 quantities from L0/packet files and calculates L2 quantities
   2) the second section demonstrates how to get the quantities without the wrapper routine
   3) the third section demonstrates how to get l2 quantities from L2 files


Notes:
 -works best with full data
 -moments don't work well with reduced data 
 -data prior to 2007-03-30 may have errors in ETC table maps 
  that produce errors in moments and distributions
 -variable/routine names: 
     Particle variables/routines follow the naming convention 
          th[a/b/c/d/e]_p[e/s][i/e][f/r/b]  
     where 
          th=themis, [a/b/c/d/e]=spacecraft, p=particle, 
          [e/s]=ESA or SST instrument, [i/e]=ion/electron, 
          [f/r/b]=full/reduced/burst distribution

Procedure: thm_crib_esa_slice2d

Propose:   Example to call the pro file of thm_esa_slice2d. PNG or PS files of ESA (ion or
           electron) Distribution Functions for the spacecraft (sc) and the type of data (full, reduced
           or burst) would be automatically printed, and the output file would be a 2-D slice of the
           3-D distribution function. The detailed slice properties (such as the definition of x and y
           axis, the two limits of the slice, etc) can be found in thm_esa_slice2d.

Remarks:   You can select a start time and an end time to produce a set of distribution function plots
           with the time increments (specified by INCREMENT) no less than 3 seconds. For each plot, it
           is allowed to have a longer interval than 3 seconds (specified by TIMEINTERVAL) with the
           distribution function being averaged during the whole time interval. Also you need to designate
           the folder (specified by OUTPUTFOLDER) that you wish to put the output files.

PROCEDURE: thm_crib_part_getspec

  ***** A copy and paste crib *****

PURPOSE:
  A crib showing how to create energy and angular spectrograms using
  THM_PART_GETSPEC.

DETAILS
  THM_PART_GETSPEC is a wrapper that takes user input and creates tplot
  variables containing energy and/or angular spectra of ESA and SST data. The
  tplot variables created end in 'en_eflux' for energy spectra and 'an_eflux'
  plus a suffix corresponding to the type of angular spectrum specified by
  the ANGLE keyword for angular spectra by default. The user can select a
  range of probe(s), PROBE, and time range, TRANGE, of interest. The energy
  range of interest, ERANGE, is specified in eV. The user can also choose to
  create tplot variable for one or more data types, DATA_TYPE. The phi, PHI,
  and theta, THETA, ranges of interest, specified in DSL coordinates, can also
  be input, by the user. SUFFIX specifies a string that will be added to the
  *an_eflux*' tplot variables.

  If the phi range is greater than 360 degrees, then the phi bins at the
  beginning of the phi range are added and wrapped around the end of phi
  range. For example, if phi=[0,420], the phi bins corresponding to 0-60
  degrees are appended to the top of the plot.

  The START_ANGLE keyword specifies the start of the y-axis (phi). This is
  useful to center the spectra plot on the y-axis at a particular phi angle.
  If this keyword is not set, the y-axis starts at the first angle input to
  the PHI keyword.

  Use the ENERGY and ANGLE keywords to specify whether to create tplot
  variables for energy and/or angular spectra. The ANGLE keyword is also used
  to specify the type of angular spectrum created (e.g. phi, theta, pa, gyro).
  If neither of ENERGY and ANGLE keywords are specified, then both are turned
  on and the angular spectrum type defaults to phi.

  When set, the AUTOPLOT keyword enables to the tplot variables to be
  automatically plotted using some simple code located at the end of
  THM_PART_GETSPEC. The tplot variables created are properly formatted by
  THM_PART_MOMENTS2 and THM_PART_GETSPEC whether or not AUTOPLOT is set.
  Setting AUTOPLOT will also create a default tplot title containing the
  theta, phi, and energy ranges used to create the plot.

  After reading in the user's input, THM_PART_GETSPEC then calls THM_LOAD_SST
  and/or THM_LOAD_ESA_PKT to load the particle data.  THM_PART_MOMENTS2 is
  then called to format the spectra data based on the user's input and create
  the tplot variables.  THM_PART_MOMENTS2 calls THM_PART_GETANBINS in order to
  determine which energy/angle bins should be turned on/off. If there's a mode
  change, THM_PART_MOMENTS2 will re-call THM_PART_GETANBINS to account for any
  changes in the mode's anglemap.

  Pitch angle (ANGLE='pa') and gyrovelocity (ANGLE='gyro') spectra are generated
  by gridding a globe in a field-aligned coordinate (FAC) system at regular
  intervals along pitch (latitude) and gyrovelocity (longitude) as specified by
  the REGRID keyword. These FAC angle bins are then rotated back into the
  native DSL coordinates of the particle distribution data. The flux assigned
  to a given FAC angle bin is determined by native angle bin to which the center
  of FAC angle bin has been rotated. So if a FAC angle bin center is rotated
  into the 88th angle bin of the probe's particle distribution data, the flux
  for that FAC angle bin is the same as the flux in angle bin 88 of the
  particle distribution data. This rotation occurs for each time sample of the
  probe's particle data.

  The size of the FAC system grid is specified with the REGRID = [m,n], a two-
  element array in which the first element of the array specifies the number
  of grid elements in the gyrovelocity (longitudinal) direction while the second
  element sets he number of grid elements in the pitch (latitudinal)
  direction.  Increasing the number of elements in the FAC system grid will
  increase the accuracy of the pitch angle and gyrovelocity angle spectra as it
  decreases the degree to which the FAC bins overlap into one or more native
  distribution angle bin. Suitable numbers for m and n are numbers like 2^k.
  So far, k=2-6 has been tested and work. Other numbers will work provided
  180/n and 360/m are rational.

  The PITCH and GYRO keywords set the angle range of interest for pitch angle
  and gyrovelocity spectra plots similarly to the THETA and PHI keywords.
  Setting PHI and THETA will affect pitch angle and gyrovelocity plot, but the
  PITCH and GYRO keywords will be ignored when the ANGLE keyword is set to
  'PHI' or 'THETA'. Energy spectra, generated by using the /ENERGY keyword, will
  also be affected by PITCH and GYRO settings. 

  The OTHER_DIM keyword specifies the second axis for the field aligned
  coordinate system, necessary when plotting pitch angle or gyrovelocity spectra.
  See THM_FAC_MATRIX_MAKE for more info. If the keyword is not set in
  THM_PART_GETSPEC, OTHER_DIM defaults to 'mphigeo'.

  Also, when calculating pitch angle and/or gyrovelocity spectra
  THM_FAC_MATRIX_MAKE might require the data be de-gapped in order to
  calculate the rotation matrix. If so, the /degap keyword and tdegap keywords
  can passed in the call to THM_PART_GETSPEC.  See TDEGAP and
  THM_FAC_MATRIX_MAKE for more info.

  The /NORMALIZE keyword will normalize the flux for each time sample in a
  spectra plot to values between 0 and 1.
  
  BADBINS2MASK is a 0-1 array that will be mask SST bins with a NaN to
  eliminate artifacts such as sun contamination. The array should have the same
  number of elements as the number of angle bins for a given data type. A 0
  indicates that will be masked with a NaN. This is basically the output from
  the bins argument of EDIT3DBINS.
  
  The DATAGAP is very useful when you want to overlay burst mode spectra plots
  over full mode spectra. Set the DATAGAP keyword to a number of seconds that
  is less than the time gap of the burst data, but greater than the sample
  interval of the underlying full mode data.  This way the time gaps between
  the burst mode data won't be interpolated by SPECPLOT and cover up the full
  mode data between the burst mode data. 


NOTES:
	- All angles are in DSL coordinates
	- All datatypes are now valid
   - Theta input must satisfy: -90 &lt; theta[0] &lt; theta[1] &lt; 90
   - Phi input must be specified in ascending order in degrees
     (e.g. [270, 450] or [-90, 90] to specify the 'daylight' hemisphere in DSL
     coordinates)
   - Incorporates improvements contained in v1.2

PROCEDURE: thm_crib_tplot_overlay

  ***** A copy and paste crib *****

PURPOSE:
  A crib showing how to overlay spectra on top of spectra.

DETAILS
  This crib shows how to combine full and burst mode spectra into one plot by
  overlaying the burst mode data on top of the full mode data.

  The DATAGAP keyword is very useful when you want to overlay burst mode
  spectra plots over full mode spectra. Set the DATAGAP keyword to a number
  of seconds that is less than the time gap of the burst data, but greater than
  the sample interval of the underlying full mode data.  This way the time gaps
  between the burst mode data won't be interpolated by SPECPLOT and cover up
  the full mode data between the burst mode data.
