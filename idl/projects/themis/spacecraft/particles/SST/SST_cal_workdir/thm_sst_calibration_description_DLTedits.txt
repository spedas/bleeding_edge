Overview: 
  THEMIS SST is a suite of instruments used to measure energetic particle flux 
around each THEMIS spacecraft. They're designed to discriminate between species
(ion or electron),  energy, and angle for each incident particle. Measurements
are binned at regular intervals to reduce data volume; providing a data product
of angle,energy,time, and species. When combined with magnetic field data 
measured by other THEMIS instruments, this allows us to produce pitch angle
spectra for energetic particle fluxes near the THEMIS spacecraft.  When 
intercalibrated with ESA data, we can create moment data for the full space 
plasma distribution around each THEMIS spacecraft.

Physical description:
 There is one instrument suite on each of the five THEMIS spacecraft.  Each 
instrument suite is composed of two separate units.  Each unit has two detector
stacks.  Each stack can accept particles from two apertures in the unit chassis.
The two apertures are at opposite ends of detector stack. One of
the two apertures is obscured by a thin foil, which filters protons
from passing the aperture and acts as a high-energy pass filter for electrons.
However, protons above ~350 keV can penetrate the shield, resulting in cross-
contamination. The other aperture on each stack is crossed
by a permanent magnet.  This magnet is sized to deflect electrons away from
the stack but not ions because electrons have a much smaller gyro-radius than ions. 
Electrons above ~300 keV can pass through the magnet into the detector stack, also 
resulting in cross-contamination. Each detector stack is composed of three silicon 
detectors designated Foil(F) , Thick(T), and Open(O).  The foil detector is the detector 
nearest the foil aperture. The open detector is the detector nearest the permanent 
magnet.  The thick detector sits between the foil and open detector. It is called 
the thick detector because the thick detector is roughly twice the thickness of the 
other detectors.  
  Each detector stack in a SST unit is oriented anti-parallel to the other SST unit 
in each suite. This means that each ion aperture(O) is physically adjacent to an electron 
aperture(F) from the adjacent detector stack in the same unit.  One of the two
units on each spacecraft is oriented such that the vector pointing out of each
aperture forms a 25 degree angle with the spacecraft spin plane in a plane
that is perpendicular to the spacecraft spin plane. The second of the two units
on each spacecraft is oriented such that the vector pointing out of each 
aperture forms a 52 degree angle with the spacecraft spin plane in a plane that
is perpendicular to the spacecraft spin plane. Since one aperture on each unit
is pointing up and the other is pointing down, with respect to the spacecraft
spin plane, this gives us four different look directions.(-52,-25,25,52) We
will call this angle, in the plane perpendicular to the spin plane, "theta"
for the purposes of SST calibrations. Theta is measured such that a vector
in the spin plane has a zero theta angle. Thetas have a range from -90 to +90
degrees. (Should have some pictures around here, 'cause geometry is hard to explain)
  Each spacecraft spins with a ~3 second period.  With timing
information, the SST can use the spacecraft spin to collect data about 3-dimensional
particle distributions around the spacecraft.  For the purposes of SST calibrations, 
we will call the spin phase angle around the spin plane the "phi" angle. Any vector 
in the plane containing a vector pointing from the spacecraft to the sun will have a 
zero phi angle. Phi angles have a range from 0 to 360 degrees.
  Each combination of aperture & detector has a geometric factor of 0.1 cm2*sr.
This factor is determined purely from the mechanical geometry of each unit.
The geometric factor is defined as the detector surface area in cm2
multiplied by the detector field of view in steradians.
 Each SST aperture has a movable plate which may be placed in front of the 
aperture.  This plate has a small hole which is calculated to reduce the
geometric factor by a factor of 64.  During periods of high flux the attenuator
is closed(put in front of the aperture) to prevent the SST from saturating.
 The SST instruments saturate at count levels near ~15,000 counts/sec.  Note that the 
attenuator on THEMIS D failed for one of the units (what was the date?) and has 
subsequently been disabled.

Logical description:

  Energy discrimination: 
  Particles traveling through each silicon detector stack deposit energy as 
they travel; eventually stopping or leaving the stack.  The amount of energy
deposited in the stack's silicon detectors from a particle collision is measured 
by the SST. A histogram(binning) is constructed to store this distribution of 
particles, with histogram bin boundaries configured during ground operations.
  Particles may interact with one or more detectors during an interaction
event.  Separate energy histograms and bin boundaries are used for each
pattern of coincident interaction with detectors.  That is, there is one
set of energy bins for particles that interact with the F detector but
not the T or O detector.  One for the F & T detector but not the O detector. 
This gives us seven possible coincidence patterns:
F,FT,FTO,O,OT,O,FO
The only pattern that is not telemetered to ground is the FO pattern, which
is deemed to be improbable enough that it is not worth the bandwidth. Which
energy bin is incremented is based off the total energy deposited in the stack
during an event.  For example, if a particle deposits 300 keV on the F 
detector and 100 keV on the T detector, it will be classified as an FT event
and binned as a particle with 300+100=400 keV.
32 energy bins are telemetered to the ground for each angle and time. These 32
bins are configured during operations to a predefined set of coincidence bins.
Notionally, these bins are split into 16 ion and 16 electron energy bins, but
for the more complicated coincidence bins, this definition is somewhat blurred.
The configuration used after early operations is as follows:
(This should be a table, see document: 
themis/spacecraft/particles/SST/SST_cal_workdir/thm_sst_edep_boundaries.txt)

Angle discrimination:
  Each energy histogram is collected separately for each detector stack. Since
each stack has a different theta angle, four different theta angle bins 
can be telemetered to the ground for each spacecraft. All four bins are
downlinked.  As mentioned above, the center points of these bins have theta
angles of -52,-25,25, & 52 degrees.  These samples are taken to represent 
the ranges [-90,-45],[-45,0],[0,45],[45,90], but because the aperture is quite
small (~30 degrees full angle !!! MAKE SURE THIS IS RIGHT), it does not actually collect particles from this whole range.
  As the spacecraft spins, the phi angle of the vector pointing down the length
of each stack changes due to the rotation of the spacecraft. Every 1/16th of
a spin a new set of histograms is started.  The spin period is nominally
3 seconds, thus each phi bin integrates for 3/16 seconds, and covers an angle
range that is 22.5 degrees wide in phi.
  Combining theta & phi together, the SST measures 64 different angles every
spin. Most often, angle data are stored as a 64 element array and not a
4x16 element array.  The angle ordering is as follows:

Time discrimination:
  Times are stored at every phi sampling.  Currently, the full set of 
energy & angles are downlinked every spin. (Giving the data a 3 second cadence)
  During some periods of the mission, the configuration varied so that a
spin's worth of data was downlinked every 64 spins during lower priority
intervals to save bandwidth.  This was called snapshot mode.  The instrument
was configured in this mode when the spacecraft IDPU was in slow survey mode.
If the spin was exactly 3 seconds, this would have given the data a 192
second cadence during slow survey.  In practice, the spin was not exactly 3
seconds, but the exact spacing between snapshots can be retrieved from the 
data time tags.  [TIME TAGS CORRESPOND TO TIME CENTERS, RIGHT???  ALSO, WE SHOULD SPECIFY
THE DIFFERENT MODES AND SURVEY RATES I THINKâ€¦ DLT]

  (not getting into reduced/burst modes here)

 When imported into IDL the raw data are stored as a time series array 
of 16 energy by 64 angle data, initially.  Later the data are stored as 
time series arrays of structures which describe all the data & calibration
for each spin of data.

Calibration process:
SST calibration has 3 high level goals.
#1 Convert spacecraft digital count data into physical units.(flux & energy flux, eflux)
#2 Decontaminate data. (Remove sun & electronic noise, cross-contamination, and shield penetrating particles)
#3 Calculate derived products like energy eflux spectrograms, time series
moments(density, temperature vector, pressure tensor, velocity), and angular
spectra(phi,theta,pitch angle, gyrophase)

Calibration is performed separately for ions & electrons, where ions & 
electrons refer to the 16 energy bins which are notionally associated with
the coincidence channels for that particle species.

Physical Unit Conversion:
When data are imported, energy boundaries & angles are assigned to each count
bin.  Times are provided by the spacecraft. 

Angles: Measurement angles are determined
strictly from the instrument geometry and the binning logic described above.

Energy:
SST ion and electron response functions were modeled in GEANT4 by Drew Turner.  The
resulting response functions were used to determine the energy boundaries for the ion
and electron energy bins.  A CAD model of the instrument and the edep configuration was 
used to determine the mean incident energy of particles that deposit energy on the 
detectors in the configured range.  The ion energy boundaries were very similar to what 
was initially estimated by Davin Larson, the SST instrument PI (USING THE BETHE-BLOCH 
FORMULA???), but the electron energy bins were significantly different (WHICH MAKES 
SENSE SINCE THE BETHE-BLOCH FORMULA IS INVALID FOR ELECTRONS). 

Dead Layer:
An offset in keV is added to the energy boundaries to account for the detector
dead layer.  The detector dead layer is a layer of silicon on the surface of
each detector from which charge cannot be collected, and thus energy deposition
in this region is unmeasured.  The dead layers grow in time, and by increasing the energy boundary for a calculated channel, we can account for this unmeasured energy.  The dead 
layer was determined by Drew Turner through intercalibration with the THEMIS ESA 
instruments.  The dead layer on some spacecraft has grown rapidly on some of 
the spacecraft since launch.  The current cause is unknown, but the growth
has been greater on the spacecraft which have undergone more frequent 
maneuvers (i.e., the ARTEMIS spacecraft). One hypothesis for the rapid dead layer 
growth is thruster spray.  Since the dead layer is time varying, it is 
measured at periodic intervals and the offset is stored in a calibration
file.  A different offset is applied for each aperture of each SST unit.
(since each corresponds to a different detector surface)

Process:
#1
Data are first converted from counts to a rate, counts/second by
dividing the counts by the integration time (3/16 seconds)

#2 A dead time correction is applied.  Dead time represents a period of time
where the instrument cannot measure counts after a count is measured because
the instrument electronics are recovered.  The probability of a second count
arriving during this dead time interval should follow Poisson statistics and be
a function of the count rate and length of dead time for each count.The 
correction factor should have units of seconds/count.  The current formula for
the correction is:
corrected_rate=count_rate/(1-dead_factor*count_rate)
Since little is known about the dead time of the instrument due to limited 
availability of pre-flight test data, the dead time correction is factor is 
currently set to zero. Future work includes statistical analysis of the shape
of the energy spectrum as count rates grow to determine the proper correction.

#3 The corrected rate data are divided by the notional geometric factor 
0.1 cm2*sr (or 1/64 times this if attenuators are closed), converting into units of counts/sec/cm2/sr

#4 The geometric rate data are divided by the energy width of the channel
in eV to create differential flux data in units of counts/sec/cm2/sr/eV.

#5 The flux data are divided by the modeled efficiencies. Efficiencies
are from the response functions produced from the GEANT4 results.
They represent the fact that not every particle penetrates to the expected
depth(some deflect out of the stack).  Thus the instrument does not collect
100% of the incident particles in the expected energy range.  These efficiencies
will be a dimensionless value on the interval (0,1] and will not change with 
time.

#6 The flux data are divided by practical(or geometric) efficiencies. These 
represent the different charge collection performances of each physical
detector because of manufacturing variance and handling. These efficiencies
will be dimensionless value on the interval (0,1].
These values were determined by Drew Turner by intercalibration of pitch angle distributions using the four different anodes per species per SST suite.  ESA data were used to determine intervals when the particle distribution
was isotropic and factors were selected such that the made the SST distribution near
isotropic and symmetric about 90 deg pitch angle. 

#7 If conversion to energy eflux is desired, the corrected flux data are 
multiplied by the mean energy for each channel.

Decontamination:
Primary data contamination is caused by sunlight.  During times when the sun
shines on the detector (most effective on the ion side) count rates go off scale high.  
Secondary contamination is generated due to cross talk within the instrument electronics when one 
detector is seeing sun.  This is one explanation for sunlight-like contamination in the electron channels, which should be light tight because of the foil.  Contamination has also been noticed due to sunlight
reflected off the earth.(Earth shine) during perigee and also from the moon (affecting the ARTEMIS spacecraft only).  Bin contamination
patterns were determined by Jim McTiernan by doing a long time interval
examination of count rates.  Contamination is seen in two patterns, which
vary seasonally with a small amount of overlap during transitional times.
More information can be seen here:
http://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/~jimm/themis/SST/thm_soc_XXX_sst_cotaminated_bins.pdf

While there are complex options available to select the particular method of
contamination and to select the contaminated bins by hand, the simplest 
method flags all energies and times for contaminated angles as contaminated.
These data are removed and the data are linearly interpolated across phi to
remove the missing data.  For sunlight decontamination options see: themis/examples/thm_crib_sst_contamination.pro in the TDAS library.

DECONTAMINATION FOR X-CONTAMINATION AND SHIELD PENETRATING ELECTRONS!  WE NEED TO INCLUDE
THIS EVENTUALLY.

Derived Products:
Before derived products can be calculated several corrections are required
so that data may be processed using standardized data analysis routines.

Coincidence channel merge:
Ions:
A physical ion distribution is constructed by discarding the highest 
4 of the 16 SST ion energy bins.  This is because we expect that ions will 
only penetrate to the O coincidence channel. (Due to the low penetration
depth of ions in matter.)  Only protons above ~6 MeV can penetrate fully through the 
open detector and into the thick detector, so this effectively sets the high energy 
threshold for ions to < 6 MeV.

Electrons:
A physical electron distribution is constructed by merging the F & FT 
coincidence channels.  This is done by replacing energy bins 8-10(counting
from zero) with bins 12-14 of the 16 SST electron energy bins.  Then bins
11-15 are discarded. While we expect that some high energy electrons
are expected to create FTO events, the calibration parameters of this 
channel are not well understood enough to include in our final product.  

Additional considerations must be accounted for when working with FTO data.  First, 
the geometric factor of the FTO channels is essentially double that of the F and FT 
channels, since relativistic electrons coming through either side of the instrument 
can satisfy the FTO logic.  The GEANT4 simulations revealed the FTO response function 
to be essentially an integral response, responding with efficiency below ~40% for all 
electrons above ~700 keV.  The efficiency rises above 10% around 0.8 MeV, peaks at 
~38% around 1.2 MeV and falls below 10% at energies >4 MeV.  For this reason, Drew 
Turner uses an effective energy range of ~0.8-4 MeV for the FTO channel, and the 
channel can be treated as either integral or a very, very broad differential channel.
Also, FTO fluxes should be decontaminated for at least attenuator-penetrating electrons, 
which are significantly efficient at FTO channel contamination (efficiencies ~3% above 1.5 MeV).

The other coincidence channels are available to researchers through options
in the THEMIS Data Analysis Tools(TDAS).  We believe they're most useful
for assessing noise and the rates for high energy shell penetrating background
radiation.

Energy Channel Alignment:
Because the dead layer varies for each different detector & species, the energy
bins for each theta are different. This makes generation of products which 
require multiple look directions difficult.  The increased minimum energy
of SST later in the mission has also significantly increased the energy gap 
between the THEMIS ESA & SST instruments.  This gap makes the creation of
combined moments for the whole particle distribution around the THEMIS
spacecraft difficult.

To align the energy channels between thetas within the SST and between the SST 
& ESA a dynamic interpolation process is used.
#1 ESA & SST data are loaded and converted into flux units.
#2 ESA data are linearly interpolated in time to match the measurement times
of the SST. (The collection rates are not always the same) This is done
using the IDL routine "interpol"
#3 ESA data are spherically interpolated to match the look directions of the
SST.  (The ESA has 88 look directions, the SST has 64) This interpolation
is done using the IDL routine griddata
#4 The flux data for SST-matched-ESA data and SST data are interpolated for
each angle and time to a set of notional energies that fill the gap and
are the same for each look direction. The interpolation is done using the
log of energy as the independent variable and the log of flux as the 
dependent variable.  A linear interpolation is inappropriate given the power
law distribution of particle data as a function of energy.

Now we calculate products:
Probably need descriptions of how we calculate moments, energy spectra, and
angular spectra....moments and energy are straightforward.  I don't even
want to think about writing the section for angular spectra.
