3. We strongly recommend working directly or checking
with the PI and instrument coIs regarding data
interpretation, especially in the initial phase of
the project, and well in advance to submitting
a talk/publication, in order to be informed of the
nuances (and accuracy) of the THEMIS dataset.

4. If PI/coIs are not part of the publication
list, then Credit/Acknowledge the THEMIS team and NASA as follows:
