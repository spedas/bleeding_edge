NAME:    lomo_init

PURPOSE:
   Initializes system variables for lomo. Currently the variable only contains information
   on lomo elfin local data directory. Lot's more features should be added. See thm_init
   for examples.

NOTE:
   The system variable !LOMO is defined here, just like !THEMIS.
   The elements of this structure are explained below:

   !LOMO.LOCAL_DATA_DIR    This is the root location for all Lomonosov data files.
                  The Lomonosov software expects all data files to reside in specific subdirectories relative
                  to this root directory.;

   !LOMO.REMOTE_DATA_DIR   This is not implemented yet because there is no server at this point in time. 
                  A URL will most likely be available after launch. 

KEYWORDS:
   RESET:           Reset !lomo to values in environment (or values in keywords).
   LOCAL_DATA_DIR:  use given value for local_data_dir, rather than environment. Only works on
                    initial call or reset.
   REMOTE_DATA_DIR: Not yet implemented. 
   NO_COLOR_SETUP   do not set colors if already taken care of

NAME:
  lomo_load_att
           This routine loads local ELFIN ENG Lomonosov attitude data.
KEYWORDS (commonly used by other load routines):
  DATATYPE = (Currently downloads all data types. Should change that.)
  LEVEL    = levels include 1 (2 will be available shortly)
  TRANGE   = (Optional) Time range of interest  (2 element array), if
             this is not set, the default is to prompt the user. Note
             that if the input time range is not a full day, a full
             day's data is loaded
  LOCAL_DATA_DIR = local directory to store the CDF files; should be set if
             you're on *nix or OSX, the default currently assumes the IDL working directory
  SOURCE   = sets a different system variable. By default the MMS mission system variable
             is !elf
  TPLOTNAMES = set to override default names for tplot variables
  NO_UPDATES = use local data only, don't query the http site for updated files.
  SUFFIX   = append a suffix to tplot variables names

EXAMPLE:
   lomo_load_state, trange=['2016-06-24', '2016-06-25']

NOTES:
  Need to add feature to handle more than one days worth of data
  Need to add feature to delete variables that weren't requested by the user

NAME: 
  lomo_load_data
           This routine loads local ELFIN Lomonosov data. 
           There is no server available yet so all files must
           be local. The default value is currently set to
          'C:/data/lomo/elfin/l1/'
          If you do not want to place your cdf files there you 
          must change the lomonosov system variable !lomo.local_data_dir = 'yourdirectorypath'
KEYWORDS (commonly used by other load routines):
  INSTRUMENT = options are 'fgm', 'epd', 'eng' (This will probably change
               after launch 
  DATATYPE = This is not yet implemented and may not be needed
  LEVEL    = This is not yet implemented but options will  most likely include 
             levels 1 or 2. For Elfin lomonosov fgm will be the only instrument
             that has level 2 data. epd and eng only have level 1. Levels
             have also not been implemented in the load panel gui. 
  TRANGE   = (Optional) Time range of interest  (2 element array), if
             this is not set, the default is to prompt the user. Note
             that if the input time range is not a full day, a full
             day's data is loaded
          
EXAMPLE:
   lomo_load_data,probe='x'
 
NOTES:
   Elfin lomonosov has limited data availability

NAME:
  lomo_ui_load_data

PURPOSE:
  This routine provides examples for building load data panel widgets and 
  handles the widget events it produces. This is a template only and creates 
  basic widgets that are common to most missions. 
  Each mission is different. Some widgets may need to be added to fully specify
  the data set to be loaded or some may not be needed.

NAME:
  lomo_ui_load_data_load_pro

PURPOSE:
  This routine provides an example for loading data into the GUI from the load
  data panel. The purpose of this routine is to provide a wrapper around the 
  actual load data procedure (which is mission specific). This routine handles
  all the 'administrative' work of validating times, checking if data exists,
  and adding the data to the GUI's loadedData object. The loadedData object 
  loads and tracks all data that is available to the GUI. 

 INPUT:
  loadStruc - this structure contains all the mission specific information that
              is required by the procedure that loads the data. 
              For purposes of demonstration, this rouine uses the following 
              parameters:
              instrument - character string (or array) containing the name of
                           the instrument such as 'fgm', 'epd', or eng
              datalevel - L1 or L2 
              datatype - for fgm (mag) 
                       - add types for epd and eng
              time range - an array of 2 character strings containing the 
                           start and stop times of the data to be loaded.
                           ['2007-03-23/00:00:00', '2007-03-24/00:00:00']       
  loadedData - the loaded data object contains information on all variables 
               currently loaded in the gui. This object is used by many other
               panels to display the variables that are available to the GUI.
               Whenever new data is imported to the GUI this object must be 
               updated.
  statusBar - the status bar object used to display textual information 
              for the user and is located at the bottom of the load windows.
              This object can be used to inform the user of successful 
              executions, warnings, and/or errors. 
  historyWin - the history window object displays all messages generated 
               during this session.
  parent_widget_id - the widget ID of the parent. This ID is needed for 
                     appropriate layering and modality of popups
  
  KEYWORDS (OPTIONAL):
  replay - set this flag to replay previous dproc operations 
  overwrite - this flag allows the replay of user overwrites
