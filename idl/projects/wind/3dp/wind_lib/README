Notes to People who would like to edit the wind_lib source code:
This applies ONLY to people with an account on aeolus and with permission
to edit the source code.  Please don't muck with the source code if
you don't know what you are doing.  Any changes you make will affect the 
master copy of the source code!

Please contact Davin Larson before attempting to check out files and edit
them.

Step 1:
  Create a directory structure somewhere in your home directory called:
"source/wind_lib".  cd into that directory.

Step 2:
from the wind_lib directory, create a symbolic link to the master source 
directory.  Type:

ln -s /disks/aeolus/home/wind/source/wind_lib/SCCS

Step 3:
Get the source code and compile it by typing:

make





To determine who has a file checked out type:
sccs info


To edit a source file you must first check it out by typing:
sccs edit FILENAME
Use any editor to edit it.  Then recompile by typing:
make


When the code compiles successfully, you may check the file in:
sccs delta FILENAME
Do this ONLY if it compiles successfully! 
to check in multiple files type:
sccs delta `sccs tell -u`


To create a new file under the sccs system, type:
sccs create FILENAME
(Try to avoid doing this.)
you will also need to edit the makefile to add the new source code file(s)

for more info on "sccs" use the man pages.



Notes:
- Make changes only under your own user account. Do NOT use the wind 
account to make changes.

- Do not change the permissions of the files.  They are read only for
a purpose.  checking a file out will change the permission for you.

- Do not check out files for long periods of time.

- Check a file out BEFORE editing.  Remember that someone else might be
editing the same file.

- Do not try to cd into the SCCS directory and absolutely do not muck with
the files in it.
