The WIND program was intended as a debugging tool for the wind_lib library of
subroutines.  However, it can be used to create simple ascii files of 
decomutated data.  It accepts only a few simple commands:


>mastfile MASTFILENAME
MASTFILENAME should be the name of the master file that gives the location
of all 3dp data.  This file is created by the program "3dpfile".
Default is "mastfile"

>outputdir DIRNAME/  
Defines "DIRNAME/" to be the string that is prepended to all output files
created by the WIND program.
Default is "" (empty; current directory).

>begintime YY-MM-DD/HH:MM:SS
Defines the starting time of interest.  trailing zeros are not neccesary.
Default is the last (most recent) data file in 

>endtime YY-MM-DD/HH:MM:SS
Defines the endtime.

>deltat  NUM_HOURS
Alternative to endtime.  specifies NUM_HOURS hours of data to be loaded.

>print
Display list of print options.

>print  XXXX
Sets a printing flag so that data of format XXXX is dumped into the file
with the name "DIRNAME/XXXX".  This command should be run prior to the load 
command.

>load
Loads the specified time range of data into memory, printing the data selected
with the print command as it loads.

>get
Display list of data types to get.

>get XXXX
Gets the data option XXXX.  This routine is intended only for debugging 
the sdt interface routines.  This command should be run after the load command.

>file COMMANDFILE
COMMANDFILE is the name of a file that contains any of the previous commands.

>exit
Exit the program.
