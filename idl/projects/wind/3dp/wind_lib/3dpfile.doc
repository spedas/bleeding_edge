PRODUCING A MASTFILE..

  Each Co-I will store their data in a directory structure of their 
own choosing.  All decomutation software must be be able to access the data.
This is done using a file that keeps a time ordered list of ALL online
data files.  We call this file "mastfile" but any name may be used.
each line in mastfile should give the start time, end time and full pathname
for each data file using the following format:

 94-11-18/00:00:36  94-11-18/23:59:38  /data/wi_lz_3dp_19941118_v01.dat

Such a file can be easily produced using the program "3dpfile".  This program
outputs a line similar to the above line for each data file listed as a 
command line argument.  Error messages are output to stderr.
The typical means of creating mastfile is to type the following at the UNIX prompt:

3dpfile /data/* | sort > mastfile

This will print a line for each data file in the /data directory, sort them
in time order, and place the output in the file mastfile.

Each investigator is responsible for maintaining their own copy of the
mastfile.
