Rules of the Road for working with DSCOVR data

1. Data are free for scientific publications.

2. We strongly recommend working directly or checking
with the PI and instrument coIs regarding data
interpretation, especially in the initial phase of
the project, and well in advance to submitting
a talk/publication, in order to be informed of the
nuances (and accuracy) of the DSCOVR dataset.
