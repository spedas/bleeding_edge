Routine to load STATIC L3 moments into IDL tplot: density, temperature, and eventually flow and winds.

KEYWORDS:
Set /den to load STATIC densities for the five major species: H+, m/q=2 (typically He++ in the solar wind), O+, O2+, CO2+.
Set /temp to load STATIC O2+ temperatures.

 - Setting no keywords will by default load all moment types.

Set /append to append the output tplot variables to IDL tplot memory. This means that if the loaded tplot variables already exist,
     they will be appended to, rather than being overwritten. By default, when this keyword is not set, any tplot variables with the same
     names that already exist are overwritten.

success: set to a named variable to return: 0: unsuccessful - no data loaded.
                                            1: successful - data (probably) loaded.
                                            The routine is not clever enough to provide more details - 0 means it could not find any
                                            files to load, 1 means it found some (could be density or temperature) files and loaded them.

Set /margin to extend the left hand side margin so that tplot panel titles show properly. The default settings in tplot mean that 
these don't always fit. These are changed to tplot_options, 'xmargin', [16,8].

Set /anc to load ancillary data files that include more detailed information from the density and temperature calculations. These are
typically used for calibration and checks by the instrument team, and should not be needed for most users. It is recommended that you 
contact the instrument team if you wish to use any parameters loaded using this keyword.

Set /flag to load a second set of ancillary data files that contain additional flag information, that was used to create the final flag variable
     mvn_sta_l3_density_quality_flag.

Set coltab as a float/integer to the desired color table, so that tplot variable labels can be colored correctly. If not set, the default
     value of 43 is used, via loadct2, 43. Note: in the latest version this keyword no longer works.

Set /qualc if you are using Mike Chaffins qualcolors colortable software. This supercedes the coltab keyword. If qualc is not set, 
     then the keyword coltab is used instead, which defaults to 43 if not set. Note: this routine used to run loadct2, if qualc was not set. This
     no longer happens: the user must run loadct2 before running this routine, if they want to set a specific colortable. If this routine cannot find
     an structure of array colors to use (which is obtained through either loadct2 or qualcolors), then it will use placeholder values, to avoid a crash.
     NOTE: If you use the qualcolors software, you may get a red background when loading the data if you don't use the /qualc keyword. 
           To fix this, run the following:
               @'qualcolors'
               !p.background = qualcolors.white
               !p.color = qualcolors.black 
 
If you set /leavecolors, the routine will not set any colors and will ignore the coltab and qualc keywords. Use this if you do not 
     want this routine loading a new colortable. You can fix the tplot colors outside of this routine using 
         options, 'tplotname', colors=[1,2,3,4,5]

Set filesloaded to a variable that will contain the filenames of the tplot files loaded. This output will be in string format. Files are appended in the order loaded,
     so science, ancillary and flag filenames, if /anc and /flag are set. 


OUTPUTS: 
The following IDL tplot variables:
DENSITY:
mvn_sta_l3_density : densities in cm^-3, for H+, m/q=2 (usually He++ in the solar wind, sometimes H2+ in the ionosphere), O+, O2+, CO2+.

mvn_sta_l3_density_abs_uncertainty - absolute statistical uncertainty in densities (cm^-3). Note, this is the statisical uncertainty
                                     associated with the number of counts observed. There can be other sources of uncertainty, for example
                                     from blockage caused by the spacecraft or gaps in STATICs field of view. These are not accounted for 
                                     (and are difficult to do so in an automated fashion).                                   

mvn_sta_l3_density_perc_uncertainty - statistical uncertainty in densities as a percentage of the total density for that species.

mvn_sta_l3_density_quality_flag - quality flag assigned to each data point and ion species:
                               0 = ok
                               1 = use caution (recommend not using)
                               Quality flag takes into account the statistical significance of the observed count rates, changes in
                               attenuator states, whether STATIC is pointed optimally. 
                               
mvn_sta_l3_density_light_method &amp; 
mvn_sta_l3_density_heavy_method - methods used to determine light and heavy ion densities. 
                                  0 = moment; 1, 2, or 3 = beam for O+, O2+, CO2+ respectively (different values used for viewing purposes).      
    
mvn_sta_c6_att_mode -   indicates which mode &amp; attenuator state STATIC is in  (see STATIC readme)                                            
                               
mvn_sta_l3_density_mvn_pos_mso - MAVENs position in the MSO coordinate system, in units of km, generated using SPICE.

mvn_sta_l3_density_mvn_sza - MAVENs solar zenith angle in the MSO coordinate system, in degrees, generated using SPICE.

mvn_sta_l3_density_mvn_alt_iau - MAVENs altitude in the IAU coordinate system (ie Mars is an oblate spheroid), in units of km, generated using SPICE.



TEMPERATURE:

mvn_sta_l3_temperature_o2+: O2+ temperature, mostly at c6 time cadence (4s) in eV

mvn_sta_l3_temperature_abs_uncertainty: absolute statistical uncertainty in temperature (eV). Note, this is the statisical uncertainty
                                     associated with the number of counts observed. There can be other sources of uncertainty, for example
                                     from blockage caused by the spacecraft or gaps in STATICs field of view. These are not accounted for
                                     (and are difficult to do so in an automated fashion).;
                      
mvn_sta_l3_temperature_quality_flag - quality flag assigned to each data point and ion species:
                               0 = ok
                               1 = use caution (recommend not using)
                               Quality flag takes into account the availability of corrections to s/c potential based on LPW data, 
                               and the ratio of the temperature corrections to the temperature (T_AC/T_ion, see temperature paper for 
                               definition of T_AC) 
                               
mvn_sta_l3_temperature_product - indicates which STATIC data product was used to calculate O2+ temperature.
                               0 = c6 energy beamwidth (default) 
                               1 = c8 angular beamwidth 
                               
mvn_sta_l3_sta_att_mode - indicates which mode &amp; attenuator state STATIC is in  (see STATIC readme; same as mvn_sta_c6_att_mode)                 

mvn_sta_l3_temperature_mvn_pos_mso - MAVEN's position in the MSO coordinate system, in units of km, generated using SPICE.

mvn_sta_l3_temperature_mvn_pos_geo - MAVEN's position in the planetocentric coordinate system, in units of km, generated using SPICE.

mvn_sta_l3_temperature_mvn_sza - MAVEN's solar zenith angle in the MSO coordinate system, in degrees, generated using SPICE.

mvn_sta_l3_temperature_mvn_alt_iau - MAVEN's altitude in the IAU coordinate system (ie Mars is an oblate spheroid), in units of km, generated using SPICE.

mvn_sta_l3_temperature_mvn_lst - MAVEN's local solar time, in hours.

	tbd	modify code to account for non-perfect attenuation of attE and lowest energy sample where attE is activated

	tbd	correct program for leakage by electrostatic attenuator at low energy - 
			currently these data are flagged with the quality flag

	tbd	current code uses swp2gfan and swp2gfdf to help approximate gf for omni-directional apids - c0,c2,c4,c6
			need to check whether this properly handles theta and azimuthal angle ranges
	add	gf_corr[npts,nenergy] to common blocks for apids c0,c2,c4,c6,c8 to account for sensitivity variation with ion flux direction

	tbd	may need to change the code that throws away extra data at end of file

	fix	eff array
	add	eff_ind coding from time and swp_ind
	mod	eff dimension

	mod	bkg so it varies with time (it will contain the estimated straggling counts)
	
	change	&quot;test&quot; keyword -- may have conflicts

	add	change gf to account for narrow cold beams centered on a sector - no losses from ESA exit posts or TOF posts, see lines 178 and 600

													 
		quality_flag definition						 determined from

			bit 0	test pulser on					- testpulser header bit set
			bit 1	diagnostic mode					- diagnostic header bit set
			bit 2	dead time correction &gt;2 flag			- deadtime correction &gt; 2
			bit 3	detector droop correction &gt;2 flag 		- mcp droop flagged if correction &gt; 2
			bit 4	dead time correction not at event time		- missing data quantity for deadtime
			bit 5	electrostatic attenuator failing at low energy	- attE on and eprom_ver&lt;2
			bit 6   attenuator change during accumulation		- att 1-&gt;2 or 2-&gt;1 transition (one measurement)	
			bit 7	mode change during accumulation			- only needed for packets that average data during mode transition
			bit 8	lpw sweeps interfering with data 		- lpw mode not dust mode
			bit 9	high background 		 		- minimum value in DA &gt; 10000 Hz
			bit 10	no background subtraction array		 	- dat.bkg = 0		- may not be needed
			bit 11	missing spacecraft potential			- dat.sc_pot = 0	- may not be needed	
			bit 12	inflight calibration incomplete			- date determined, set to 1 until calibration finalized
			bit 13	geometric factor problem			- 
			bit 14	ion suppression problem				- low energy ions &lt;6eV have wrong geometric factor
			bit 15	not used =0
