PROCEDURE: 
	mvn_swe_kp5
PURPOSE:
	Calculates SWEA key parameters.  The result is stored in tplot variables,
   and as a save file.

   WARNING: This routine is for use by the SWEA instrument team only.

AUTHOR: 
	David L. Mitchell
CALLING SEQUENCE: 
	mvn_swe_kp5
INPUTS:
   None:      Uses data currently loaded into the SWEA common block.

KEYWORDS:
   TRANGE:    Process data in this time range.

   PANS:      Named variable to return tplot variables created.

   MOM:       Calculate density using a moment.  This is the default and
              only option for now.

   DDD:       Calculate density from 3D distributions (allows bin
              masking).  Default is to use SPEC data.  This option fits
              a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to the core and performs
              a moment calculation for the halo.  This provides corrections
              for both spacecraft potential and scattered photoelectrons.
              (Currently disabled.)

   ABINS:     Anode bin mask - 16-element byte array (0 = off, 1 = on)
              Default = replicate(1B, 16).

   DBINS:     Deflector bin mask - 6-element byte array (0 = off, 1 = on)
              Default = replicate(1B, 6).

   OBINS:     Solid angle bin mask - 96-element byte array (0 = off, 1 = on)
              Default = reform(ABINS # DBINS, 96).

   MASK_SC:   Mask PA bins that are blocked by the spacecraft.  This is in
              addition to any masking specified by ABINS, DBINS, and OBINS.
              Default = 1 (yes).

   L2ONLY:    Only process data using L2 MAG data.

   QLEVEL:    Minimum quality level for calculations.  Filters out the vast
              majority of spectra affected by the sporadic low energy
              anomaly below 28 eV.  The validity levels are:

                0B = Data are affected by the low-energy anomaly.  There
                     are significant systematic errors below 28 eV.
                1B = Unknown because: (1) the variability is too large to 
                     confidently identify anomalous spectra, as in the 
                     sheath, or (2) secondary electrons mask the anomaly,
                     as in the sheath just downstream of the bow shock.
                2B = Data are not affected by the low-energy anomaly.
                     Caveat: There is increased noise around 23 eV, even 
                     for &quot;good&quot; spectra.

              Default for this procedure is 1B.

   OUTPUT_PATH: An output_path for testing, the save file will be put into 
                OUTPUT_PATH/yyyy/mm/.  Directories are created as needed.
                Default = root_data_dir() + 'maven/data/sci/swe/kp'.

NAME:
 mvn_swe_l2gen5
PURPOSE:
 Loads L0 data, creates L2 files for 1 day

   WARNING: This routine is for use by the SWEA instrument team only.

CALLING SEQUENCE:
 mvn_swe_l2gen5, date=date
INPUT:
   None.
KEYWORDS:
   DATE:      If set, the input date. The default is today.

   DIRECTORY: If set, output into this directory, for testing
               purposes, don't forget a slash '/'  at the end.

   L2ONLY:    If set, only generate PAD L2 data if MAG L2 data are available.

   NOL2:      If set, do not generate SWEA L2 data.  Takes precedence over the
              next three keywords.

   DOSPEC:    Process the SPEC data.  Default = 1 (yes).

   DOPAD:     Process the PAD data.  Default = 1 (yes).

   DO3D:      Process the 3D data.  Default = 1 (yes).

   DOKP:      Process the KP data.  Default = 1 (yes).

   ABINS:     Anode bin mask -&gt; 16 elements (0 = off, 1 = on)
              Default = replicate(1,16)

   DBINS:     Deflector bin mask -&gt; 6 elements (0 = off, 1 = on)
              Default = replicate(1,6)

   OBINS:     3D solid angle bin mask -&gt; 96 elements (0 = off, 1 = on)
              Default = reform(ABINS # DBINS)

   MASK_SC:   Mask the spacecraft blockage.  This is in addition to any
              masking defined by the ABINS, DBINS, and OBINS.
              Default = 1 (yes).  Set this to 0 to disable and use the
              above 3 keywords only (not recommended!).

   KP_QLEV:   Minimum quality level for calculating key parameters.  Filters out
              the vast majority of spectra affected by the sporadic low energy
              anomaly below 28 eV.  The validity levels are:

                0B = Data are affected by the low-energy anomaly.  There
                     are significant systematic errors below 28 eV.
                1B = Unknown because: (1) the variability is too large to 
                     confidently identify anomalous spectra, as in the 
                     sheath, or (2) secondary electrons mask the anomaly,
                     as in the sheath just downstream of the bow shock.
                2B = Data are not affected by the low-energy anomaly.
                     Caveat: There is increased noise around 23 eV, even 
                     for &quot;good&quot; spectra.

              Default for this procedure is 1B.

PROCEDURE:   mvn_swe_load_l2a
PURPOSE:
  Reads in MAVEN Level 2 telemetry files (CDF format).  Data are stored in 
  a common block (mvn_swe_com).

   WARNING: This routine is for use by the SWEA instrument team only.

  SWEA data structures are:

    3D Distributions:  mvn_swe_3d

    PAD Distributions: mvn_swe_pad

    ENGY Spectra:      mvn_swe_engy

USAGE:
  mvn_swe_load_l2, trange

INPUTS:
       trange:        Load SWEA packets from L2 data spanning this time range.
                      (Reads multiple L2 files, if necessary.)  This input is 
                      not needed if you first call timespan.

KEYWORDS:
       FILENAME:      Full path and file name for loading data.  Can be multiple
                      files.  Takes precedence over trange, ORBIT, and LATEST.

       ORBIT:         Load SWEA data by orbit number or range of orbit numbers 
                      (trange and LATEST are ignored).  Orbits are numbered using 
                      the NAIF convention, where the orbit number increments at 
                      periapsis.  Data are loaded from the apoapsis preceding the
                      first orbit (periapsis) number to the apoapsis following the
                      last orbit number.

       LATEST:        Ignore trange (if present), and load all data within the
                      LATEST days leading up to the current date.

       SPEC:          Load SPEC data.

       PAD:           Load PAD data.

       DDD:           Load 3D data.

       ALL:           Load SPEC, PAD, and 3D data.

       BURST:         Load burst data.  (Default is to load survey data.)

       ARCHIVE:       Synonym for BURST.  (For backward compatibility.)

       STATUS:        Report statistics of data actually loaded.

       SUMPLOT:       Create a summary plot of the loaded data.

       LOADONLY:      Download data but do not process.

       NOERASE:       Do not clear the common block before loading.  This
                      allows multiple calls to load subsets of the data.

       SPICEINIT:     Force an initialization of SPICE.  Use with caution!
                      Best practice is to initialize SPICE before calling
                      this routine (or any other data loader).

       NOSPICE:       Do not initialize SPICE.
