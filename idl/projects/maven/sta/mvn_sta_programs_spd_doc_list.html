PROCEDURE:	mvn_sta_bkg_cleanup
PURPOSE:	
	For small number backgrounds, consolidates mvn_id_dat.bkg to match with mvn_id_dat.data 
INPUT:		

KEYWORDS:
	save_bkg	0/1	if set, will save the current value of bkg in an intermediate array -- for testing
	restore_bkg	0/1	if set, will restore value of bkg in an intermediate array created by save_bkg -- for testing
	no_digitize	0/1	if set, mvn_id_dat.bkg is NOT digitized to a value equal to mvn_id_dat.data if they are statistically equivalent
					no_digitize keyword is only used for testing

CREATED BY:	J. McFadden 20/09/01
VERSION:	1
LAST MODIFICATION:  21/05/11		
MOD HISTORY:
		21/05/10	; modified so digitize will not act on C+ outside the solar wind so faint C+ signal is not removed 
		21/05/11	; changed &quot;digitize&quot; keyword to &quot;no_digitize&quot; so that normal operations don't require this keyword to be set

NOTES:	  
 	This routine should be run after all backgrounds are calculated and added to the mvn_id_dat.bkg arrays
	For small number background in a 4 sec measurement - calculated background removal fails unless averaged over long periods
	This routine consolidates the calculated fractional count background into nearby time and mass bins where actual counts are measured
	The net effect doesn't change the overall time averaged background
	The routine will further set mvn_id_dat.bkg=mvn_id_dat.data if mvn_id_dat.bkg is within 2 sigma of mvn_id_dat.data
		this feature of setting mvn_id_dat.bkg=mvn_id_dat.data for statistically equivalent values is refered to as &quot;digitize&quot;
	This results in small changes in background that are statistically insignificant on long time scales and accurate background removal on 4 sec time scales
	This digitize feature can be turned off with the &quot;no_digitize&quot; keyword - primarily for testing

MOD HISTORY:

NOTES:	  
 	bkg7 from mvn_sta_bkg_load (coincident events) are corrected for fast time variations 
	bkg7 is proportional to rate squared, so any averaging of fluctuations during a 4ms accumulation will result in underestimates of bkg
	The assumption is that high massbins=56:63 are entirely due to coincident ions unless significant o2+,co2+ is present
	Differences between dat.bkg estimate from rate^2 and dat.cnts for massbins=56:63 is assumed to be due to rapid flux changes over the 4ms accumulation time
	Correction factors to dat.bkg are based on (dat.cnts/dat.bkg) ratios and calculated for each energy using c6
	- a secondary 10% level correction is also applied based coincident timing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution
 	- it corrects for the exponential decrease in coincident events with increasing mass
	correction are based on c6, so the time base for corrections will be from c6
	c6 data for the day before and day after are loaded for intermediate calculations, but c6 is returned to a single day being loaded.
	some parameters were determined emperically defaults values see to work

	Problem: there may be a problem with not correcting if calculated bkg is greater than the cnts high mass bins 56:63
		Changed the &gt;1. to &gt;0.7 on line 238,  also may need to change value2. 
		Saw this problem on 20160402  22:23-22:50 with a weak solar wind and modified code to &gt;0.7

CREATED BY:	J. McFadden
VERSION:	1
LAST MODIFICATION:  2025/03/26   minor change to prevent NANs from a divide by zero; see lines with  &gt;1.))  added 	
MOD HISTORY:

NOTES:	  
 bkg2 is TBD - sputtered ions from the spacecraft caused by keV solar wind protons
	this background is very tenuous, appears at 1-40eV, and at 20&lt;mass&lt;30 - most likely sputtered CO2++ and CO+
	probably will not bother trying to develop this background estimation
 bkg3 is TBD - scattered ions off entrance posts and grids appearing at other energies and angles - proportional to rate
	this is primarily observed for solar wind protons below the spectral peak - about 3% of the beam counts
	the angle distribution appears to be complex so not clear whether this can be worked out
 bkg4 are internally backscattered cold ions near periapsis when the mechanical attenuator is closed
 	removal assumes all heavy ions outside of anodes 5 to 9, and with energy &lt; Esh, are background
	Esh is the highest energy where the counts in c6 exceed 1/50. of the peak counts and exceed 20 counts.
	the numbers 50 and 20 were empirically determined and should be tuned to make the algorithm work optimally 
	tf_bkg4 is use to prevent double counting in background removal
 bkg5 is TBD (disabled) caused by event straggling (energy loss) in the carbon foils and from inelastic scattering from grids at the start foil
	bkg5a are proton stragglers - proportional to event rate
 	bkg5b are alpha  stragglers - proportional to event rate
	these background are anode dependent - probably dependent on details of the grids
 bkg6 is TBD (disabled) background caused by start_no_stop followed closely by a valid event - proportional to rate squared
	at high rate, the TOF circuit may not be completely reset before the next event producing a statistical high mass tail
	bkg6 high mass tail is generally observed at masses just above the high flux mass peak (typically in solar wind)
	however, valid events that contribute to bkg6 may also be due to other forms of background -- primarily coincidence events 
 bkg7 is background from coincident events where different ions (or radiation) produce the start and stop signals - proportional to rate squared
	bkg7 has errors due to variations in flux on &lt;4ms time scales which are corrected by mvn_sta_bkg_correct.pro
	mvn_sta_bkg_correct.pro will also correct for the small variation in coincident background with mass
 bkg8 is TBD (disabled) background caused by start_no_stop followed closely by a TOF=0 event - proportional to rate squared
	bkg8 is similar to bkg6
	TOF=0 event are caused by scattered electrons that produce simultaneous start and stop signals
	because bkg8 depends on rate^2, it requires the correction calculated by mvn_sta_bkg_correct.pro
 bkg9 is background created by delayed Start signal from scattered molecular ion fragment 
	that failed to produce a start at the carbon foil but produced a Start electron when it hit another TOF analyzer surface
 bkg10 is TBD (disabled) bkg10 is internally produced background from sputtered ions generated by backscattered start-foil secondary electrons  
	the primary sputtered ion peak is C++, however O+, O++ and C+ are also observed but are much smaller
	the size of this peak depends on the incident ion mass (secondary e- production) and amount of disolved CO2 on surfaces
	therefore the size of these peaks will vary with time, anode, and composition

 this algorithm currently generates bkg4, bkg7, bkg9
 	bkg2 will likely never calculated since it is such a weak signal and depends on a complex dynamic of FOV, s/c orientation and solar wind flux
	bkg3 may never be developed due depends on a complex dynamic of FOV, s/c orientation and solar wind flux
 	bkg5,bkg6 will be treated in a separate program and use outputs from mvn_sta_bkg_correct.pro
	bkg8 will be treated in a separate program using outputs from mvn_sta_bkg_correct.pro
	bkg10 will be treated in a separate program using outputs from mvn_sta_bkg_correct.pro

CREATED BY:	J. McFadden
VERSION:	1
LAST MODIFICATION:  15/03/02
MOD HISTORY:
			14/12/20	changed algorithm to corrected valid events deadtime
						Deadtime = total(valid*dead,averaged)/total(valid,averaged)
						where &quot;valid&quot; are the valid events
							valid(energy,def) is extrapolated from apid c0 and c8
						where &quot;dead&quot; is determined by rates 
							dead(energy,def) is extrapolated from apid da and c8
							dead calculation also uses apid d8 to determine relative amounts event types (see d1,d2,d3 in code)
						where &quot;averaged&quot; accounts for averaging over energy or deflection
			15/01/17	added mcp droop correction
			15/02/25	major modifications to mcp droop correction
			17/10/02	major modifications to correctly account for background from SEP events
NOTES:	  
	Program assumes that &quot;mvn_sta_l0_load&quot; or &quot;mvn_sta_l2_load,/test&quot; has been run 
	Program requires c0,c8,d8,da packets are available at 4 sec cadence
	Program assumes Apids c2,c4,c6,ca,cd,cf,d3,d4 all have 4 second cadence
		If at some future date we are forced into slower cadence measurements, 
		then code used for apid cc can be adapted to the above apids.

TBDs
	ef3 should be made anode dependent to account for anode variations in anode rejection early in mission
	change code so that at attenuator transitions where count rates go below efficiency threshold, 
		that the code will use the nearest attenuated values, not the higher attenuated efficiency. 
		may have to break up the for-loop into 2 for-loops
	change code to default to anode efficiency based on anode rejection determination
	change code so that when background is high (as during deep dips from neutral density), the droop eff is properly calculated

MOD HISTORY:

NOTES:	  
	Program assumes that &quot;mvn_sta_l0_load&quot; or &quot;mvn_sta_l2_load,/test&quot; has been run 
	Program will use some combination of sta, lpw, swe data to estimate scpot
	Assumption 1 - O2+ ram velocity only valid below 300 km
	Assumption 2 - low energy cutoff only valid when (Ni&gt;100/cc and alt&gt;180km) or in shadow
	Assumption 3 - when the above do not apply, s/c potential set to 0V 

	TBDs - scpot is not valid 20151127/1:00UT - why is it invalid?

	&quot;cutoff&quot; keyword forces the use of c0 cutoff when pot_cutoff_valid=1 which requires enough counts - needed if winds impact potential

	Arrays
	pot 	- potential determined from Vo2-Vram in c6 time base, assume no wind, valid for altitude &lt; alt_vo2 (default=300km)
	pot1	- pot array interpolated to c0 time2 base, used in validity test to determine whether to use heavy ions in pot2 calculation
	pot2	- potential determined from ion cutoff, 3 sweeeps used to increase sensitivity, valid for alt&gt;(200.&lt;(min_alt+35.)&gt;180.), p_only=1 means only protons used
	pot3	- pot2 interpolated to c6 time base
	pot22	- potential determined from total ion cutoff with no averaging - occassionally more accurate than pot2
	pot33	- pot22 interpolated to c6 time base
	p_only	- set to 1 if only protons were used in pot2 determination
	po_only	- set to 1 if pot22 is used

	pot_alg	0 if invalid
		1 if Vo2-Vram used (ie. pot)
		2 if proton only cutoff used (ie. pot2*p_only)
		3 if all ion cutoff used (ie. pot2*(1-p_only)
		4

	the complexity of the algorith is due to:
		background coincident events must be ignored  
		scattered/trapped ions below s/c potential (especially at potentials &lt;-10V) must be ignored - these are primarily heavies
		lack of protons at &lt;180km to estimate cutoff (assume Vo2=Vram to estimate potential)
		lack of adequate CO2 counts at periapsis for O2-CO2 energy comparison
		marginal statistical counts of protons near periapsis
		transition from negative to positive potential at densities of about 8/cc
		s/c potential is always negative in shadow or in high densities

	apid c0 is used for cutoff because ti has

PROCEDURE:       mvn_sta_scpot_update

PURPOSE:         Overwrites STATIC spacecraft potentials with the
                 composite potential from mvn_scpot.  Most of this
                 code is taken from mvn_sta_scpot_load.

                 This procedure generally does not affect STATIC-
                 derived potentials in the EUV shadow, since STATIC
                 is the primary source of potentials in this region.
                 It does provide better estimates in other regions,
                 replacing the STATIC-default 0 V with real estimates
                 in many cases.

INPUTS:
      none:      All information obtained from and written to common
                 blocks.
