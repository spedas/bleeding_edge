 INPUT: energylist is a list of energies (keV)
        alt is altitude in km (20&lt;alt&lt;40)
        mlat is magnetic latitude in degrees (50&lt;|mlat|&lt;90)

 OUTPUT: returns a list of counts/s/kev corresponding to energylist
         returns -1 for input out of range

 METHOD: based on an empirical model derived from previous flights
         model is ok between 20 and 7000 keV
         background is primarily two power law components
            these turn over at low energy
            the 511 line contributes several features
         prevent underflows by avoiding exp(-huge number)

 CALLS: none

 EXAMPLE: result = brl_makebkgd([10,20,50,100],63,33.2)
            calculates bkgd differential count rate at the
            4 specified energies for a detector at mag lat
            63 degrees and altitude 33.2 km.

 FUTURE WORK:
        needs to be compared with BARREL test flights

REVISION HISTORY:
Version 1.0 DMS 7/18/12 -- split out from barrel_folding as the new top layer
                7/24/12 -- fixed minimum of plot to account for
                           possible values &lt;&lt; 1 (fixed threshold for minimum

                           when there are real values that are too low)

          2.5   1/5/13 --  rewrite to support new general
                           spectroscopy structure ss
          2.6   5/29/13 -- adding support for L2 MSPC files (already cts/keV)
          2.8   7/8/13  -- remove call to idl_screen_graphics()
          3.0   9/9/13  -- set ss.numparams here instead of upstream at barrel_sp_make()
          3.2   10/29/13 - Print total, background, and net count
                           rates just before proceeding to fit
                11/12/13 - plot data before fitting in case fit crashes
                11/12/13 - bkg_renorm defaults to zero, not 1.
          3.4   4/17/14  - Report counts &amp; electron flux for best fit.
                           Keep track of best-fit model in electron
                           space and save it and print the total.
                           Fixed bug that would use bkg_renorm
                           regardless of setting.

                           background-subtracted spectrum as error
                           This keeps very small error bars at low
                           energies from over-dominating the fit, and
                           represents, e.g., systematic uncertainties
                           in the response matrix.
          3.6 2/12/15      pass altitude to _m1 for initial param. guess

REVISION HISTORY:
Version 3.0 DMS 9/9/13
   Most recent changes from v2.9:
   remove passing x start and stop values to barrel_selecttimes 
KY 8/28/13 'brl???_' -&gt; 'brl' and '_LC' -&gt; '_FSPC' (update tplot
   variable names)
9/30/13 -- remove &quot;dobkg&quot;; whether background intervals are
   selected should automatically follow bkgmethod.
10/1/13 -- put in option for already having specified the time ranges
           by hand. (start/end times/bkgs)
10/25/13 -- add provision for start/end times entered by hand to be
           already in unix epoch (as from a prev. run)
10/29/13 - Add plot of altitude to assist in background selection
11/12/13 - Add option for vertical ticks for medium and slow spectra
11/12/13 - Add default &quot;no update&quot; for reading FSPC data
2/10/15 DMS - collect altitude using correct source time interval (average)
3/5/15 DMS - cull out &quot;NaNs&quot; from altitude data before averaging
8/20/15 DMS - fix bug wherein 3/5 fix only applied to
              screen-selected, not predetermined time intervals.
              This reorders operations somewhat 
4/5/16 DMS - fixed erroneous &quot;numspec&quot; to &quot;numbkg&quot; when looping to
             set multiple background intervals by hand.

DESCRIPTION: Spectral model file reader for barrel folding routines.
             File format must be 3 columns, start-energy, end-energy,
             flux per keV at center of the bin.

REQUIRED INPUTS:
fname     spectrum file name
phebins   energy channel boundaries desired (may or may not match file)
phmean    energy channel centers

OPTIONAL INPUTS:
none

OUTPUTS:
outspec           model spectrum in flux per keV at the values phmean

CALLS:
none

STATUS:           Tested with artificial data, both with and without interpolation

TO BE ADDED:      N/A

REVISION HISTORY:
Version 1.0 DMS 7/24/12
Version 3.4 DMS 4/17/14:  The interpolation kills a single-bin
      (monoenergetic) flux or other narrow features.  Replace
      &quot;interpol&quot; with &quot;hsi_rebinner&quot; for rebinning to our bins.
      Warning: our bins are broad so we will lose some information
      about where within the bin the flux actually is.  Use
      method=1, model=2 (precise monoenergetic) for mono. models
      instead.

 INPUT: oldBins is a list of bin edges. It contains n&gt;=2 unique
            elements sorted in ascending order
        newBins is a list of bin edges. It contains m&gt;=2 unique
            elements sorted in ascending order
        oldVals is a list of n-1 values associated to
            oldBins, the values to interpolate. That is,
            oldVals[i] is associated with the bin having edges
            (oldBins[i], oldBins[i+1]).
        flux set means oldVals are counts/binWidth, not counts

 OUTPUT: returns a list of m-1 interpolated values associated to
            newBins

 METHOD: traverse both bin lists once. For each old bin
            there are 4 possibilities:
               a) old bin precedes current new bin
               b) new bin precedes the current old bin
               c) old bin overlaps new bin, extends beyond
               d) old bin overlaps new bin, does not extend beyond
 CALLS: none

 NOTES: 1. algorithm is simple linear interpolation.
        2. The interpolated vector might contain less
            information than the input vector. Exchanging oldBins
            and newBins is not an inverse function for brl_rebin().
        3. Difference between FLUX=0 and FLUX=1: suppose
            the old and new binning schemes have the same
            total range. Then FLUX=0 preserves the sum of
            oldVals, and would be used when oldVals represents
            counts in each bin, whereas FLUX=1 preserves the dot
            product of oldVals and the (n-1 length) vector of
            differences between successive oldBin entries---used
            when oldVals has counts divided by bin width.

 WARNING: since this might be called repeatedly with only
            oldVals changing, error-checking is minimal. The
            calling routine is responsible for error-checking.

 REVISION HISTORY:

 Name: edge_products

 Purpose: From a vector of contiguous channel boundaries return the
   commonly used quantities for plotting and scaling.

 Category:
   GEN, SPECTRA

 Input: Edges -if 1d, contiguous channel boundaries, n+1 values for n channels
               if 2d, 2xn, [lo(i),hi(i)], etc., assumed contiguous for
     calculating edges_1

 Output:
   Mean - arithmetic mean of boundaries
       Gmean - geometric mean
   width - absolute difference between upper and lower edges
   edges_2 - 2xn array of edges [lo(i), hi(i)], etc.
       edges_1 - array of n+1 edges of n contiguous channels

       Keyword Input
       EPSILON - If the absolute relative difference is less than epsilon
       then two numbers are considered to be equal and a new bin is not required under
   the contiguous requirement.  If epsilon isn't passed but CONTIGOUS is set it
       attempts to construct an epsilon based on the average relative difference between
       adjacent bins, it takes that value and multiplies it by 1e-5 and limits that to
       1e-6
   CONTIGUOUS - force all edges to be contiguous, including edges_1

 Mod. History:
 ras, 21-oct-93
 8-dec-2001, richard.schwartz@gsfc.nasa.gov, added CONTIGUOUS
 added protection against degenerate entry of single value for edges,
 clearly edges_2 and width have no meaning, but are set to edges and 0.0 respectively
 25-aug-2006, ras, added epsilon and default epsilon as test
       to differentiate real numbers. If the absolute relative difference is less than epsilon
       then two numbers are considered to be equal and a new bin is not required under
   the contiguous requirement
