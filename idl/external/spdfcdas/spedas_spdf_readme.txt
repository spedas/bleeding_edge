Most recent changes: Sept 2022, using spdfcdas version 1.7.41
https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/REST/SpdfCdas-1.7.41.tar.gz

*** 0. Description *** 

This directory contains three types of files:
- spdfcdas files (27 files)
- cdawlib files (9 files)
- files created by the SPEDAS team (4 files total)

Files in this directory are required by the SPEDAS spd_spdfCdawebChooser.pro.
Parts of the spdfCdawebChooser.pro file were used in spd_spdfCdawebChooser. 
File spdfCdawebChooser.pro was created by SPDF (and it should work when it is called directly).

In the following, we list the modifications we made to the original spdfcdas+cdawlib files. 


*** 1. spdfcdas file - 27 Files *** 

Release 1.7.41 of the CDAS Web Services IDL Library
<http://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/REST/CdasIdlLibrary.html> 
that was updated for SPEDAS on Sept 22, 2022.

Local changes: 
Add the following to spdfcdawebchooser.pro: 
RESOLVE_ROUTINE, 'spd_cdawlib_virtual_funcs', /COMPILE_FULL_FILE
also, commended tvimage since there is already a SPEDAS function with this name


*** 2. spd_cdawlib file - 9 files (plus 3 files created by SPEDAS) *** 

Modified version of CDAWlib
release Jul 27, 2017
ftp://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/software/cdawlib/source/


*** 3. CDWlib file modifications *** 

Modifications are the following:
a. Added the spd_cdawlib_ prefix in front of the file names and changed any caps to lowercase.
b. Changed the main function of each file to match the filename. 
c. Added an empty pro spd_cdawlib_virtual_funcs at the end of spd_cdawlib_virtual_funcs.pro and similarly to other files that do not contain a main function or pro.
b. Removed pro BREAK_MYSTRING from spd_cdawlib_read_mycdf.pro since there is already a separate file for this.

Add the following to spd_cdawlib_virtual_funcs.pro:
pro spd_cdawlib_virtual_funcs 
; do nothing
end


*** 4. Replace strings *** 

For all the above files (25+9) the following text was replaced
for all occurrences (when spd_cdawlib_ was not already present):

plotmaster    spd_cdawlib_plotmaster
