 NAME: 
       FXADDPAR
 Purpose     : 
       Add or modify a parameter in a FITS header array.
 Explanation : 
       This version of FXADDPAR will write string values longer than 68 
       characters using the FITS continuation convention described at 
       http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/registry/continue_keyword.html
 Use         : 
       FXADDPAR, HEADER, NAME, VALUE, COMMENT
 Inputs      : 
       HEADER  = String array containing FITS header.  The maximum string
                 length must be equal to 80.  If not defined, then FXADDPAR
                 will create an empty FITS header array.

       NAME    = Name of parameter.  If NAME is already in the header the
                 value and possibly comment fields are modified. Otherwise a
                 new record is added to the header.  If NAME is equal to
                 either &quot;COMMENT&quot; or &quot;HISTORY&quot; then the value will be added to
                 the record without replacement.  In this case the comment
                 parameter is ignored.

       VALUE   = Value for parameter.  The value expression must be of the
                 correct type, e.g. integer, floating or string.
                 String values of 'T' or 'F' are considered logical
                 values unless the /NOLOGICAL keyword is set.  If the value is
                 a string and is &quot;long&quot; (more than 69 characters), then it 
                 may be continued over more than one line using the OGIP 
                 CONTINUE standard.

                 The special BOOLEAN datatype introduced in IDL 8.4 is also
                 recognized, and recorded as either 'T' or 'F' in the header.

 Opt. Inputs : 
       COMMENT = String field.  The '/' is added by this routine.  Added
                 starting in position 31.  If not supplied, or set equal to ''
                 (the null string), then any previous comment field in the
                 header for that keyword is retained (when found).
 Outputs     : 
       HEADER  = Updated header array.
 Opt. Outputs: 
       None.
 Keywords    : 
       BEFORE  = Keyword string name.  The parameter will be placed before the
                 location of this keyword.  For example, if BEFORE='HISTORY'
                 then the parameter will be placed before the first history
                 location.  This applies only when adding a new keyword;
                 keywords already in the header are kept in the same position.

       AFTER   = Same as BEFORE, but the parameter will be placed after the
                 location of this keyword.  This keyword takes precedence over
                 BEFORE.

       FORMAT  = Specifies FORTRAN-like format for parameter, e.g. &quot;F7.3&quot;.  A
                 scalar string should be used.  For complex numbers the format
                 should be defined so that it can be applied separately to the
                 real and imaginary parts.  If not supplied, then the IDL
                 default formatting is used, except that double precision is
                 given a format of G19.12.

       /NOCONTINUE = By default, FXADDPAR will break strings longer than 68 
                characters into multiple lines using the continuation
                convention.    If this keyword is set, then the line will
                instead be truncated to 68 characters.    This was the default
                behaviour of FXADDPAR prior to December 1999.  

      /NOLOGICAL = If set, then the values 'T' and 'F' are not interpreted as
                logical values, and are simply added without interpretation.

       /NULL   = If set, then keywords with values which are undefined, or
                 which have non-finite values (such as NaN, Not-a-Number) are
                 stored in the header without a value, such as

                       MYKEYWD =                      /My comment

       MISSING = A value which signals that data with this value should be
                 considered missing.  For example, the statement

                       FXADDPAR, HEADER, 'MYKEYWD', -999, MISSING=-999

                 would result in the valueless line described above for the
                 /NULL keyword.  Setting MISSING to a value implies /NULL.
                 Cannot be used with string or complex values.

       MULTIVALUE = Allow multivalue keywords.  This option was added to
                    support the DPj, DQi keywords introduced in the WCS
                    distortions paper.  With the /MULTIVALUE keyword, each new
                    instance of a keyword is added immediately after the
                    previous instance, for example:

                    FOR I=0,N_ELEMENTS(DQ1) DO FXADDPAR,HEADER,'DQ1',DQ1[I]

	ERRMSG	 = If defined and passed, then any error messages will be
		   returned to the user in this parameter rather than
		   depending on the MESSAGE routine in IDL, e.g.

			ERRMSG = ''
			FXADDPAR, ERRMSG=ERRMSG, ...
			IF ERRMSG NE '' THEN ...

 Calls       : 
       DETABIFY(), FXPAR(), FXPARPOS()
 Common      : 
       None.
 Restrictions: 
       Warning -- Parameters and names are not checked against valid FITS
       parameter names, values and types.

       The required FITS keywords SIMPLE (or XTENSION), BITPIX, NAXIS, NAXIS1,
       NAXIS2, etc., must be entered in order.  The actual values of these
       keywords are not checked for legality and consistency, however.

 Side effects: 
       All HISTORY records are inserted in order at the end of the header.

       All COMMENT records are also inserted in order at the end of the
       header, but before the HISTORY records.  The BEFORE and AFTER keywords
       can override this.

       All records with no keyword (blank) are inserted in order at the end of
       the header, but before the COMMENT and HISTORY records.  The BEFORE and
       AFTER keywords can override this.

       All other records are inserted before any of the HISTORY, COMMENT, or
       &quot;blank&quot; records.  The BEFORE and AFTER keywords can override this.

       String values longer than 68 characters will be split into multiple
       lines using the OGIP CONTINUE convention, unless the /NOCONTINUE keyword
       is set.    For a description of the CONTINUE convention see    
       http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/registry/continue_keyword.html

       William Thompson, Jan 1992, from SXADDPAR by D. Lindler and J. Isensee.
       Differences include:

               * LOCATION parameter replaced with keywords BEFORE and AFTER.
               * Support for COMMENT and &quot;blank&quot; FITS keywords.
               * Better support for standard FITS formatting of string and
                 complex values.
               * Built-in knowledge of the proper position of required
                 keywords in FITS (although not necessarily SDAS/Geis) primary
                 headers, and in TABLE and BINTABLE extension headers.

 NAME: 
	FXBADDCOL
 PURPOSE     : 
	Adds a column to a binary table extension.
 EXPLANATION : 
	Modify a basic FITS binary table extension (BINTABLE) header array to
	define a column.
 USE         : 
	FXBADDCOL, INDEX, HEADER, ARRAY  [, TTYPE [, COMMENT ]]
 INPUTS      : 
	HEADER	= String array containing FITS extension header.
	ARRAY	= IDL variable used to determine the data size and type
		  associated with the column.  If the column is defined as
		  containing variable length arrays, then ARRAY must be of the
		  maximum size to be stored in the column.
 Opt. Inputs : 
	TTYPE	= Column label.
	COMMENT = Comment for TTYPE
 Outputs     : 
	INDEX	= Index (1-999) of the created column.
	HEADER	= The header is modified to reflect the added column.
 Opt. Outputs: 
	None.
 Keywords    : 
	VARIABLE= If set, then the column is defined to contain pointers to
		  variable length arrays in the heap area.
	DCOMPLEX= If set, and ARRAY is complex, with the first dimension being
		  two (real and imaginary parts), then the column is defined as
		  double-precision complex (type &quot;M&quot;).     This keyword is
		  only needed prior to IDL Version 4.0, when the double 
		  double complex datatype was unavailable in IDL
	BIT	= If passed, and ARRAY is of type byte, then the column is
		  defined as containing bit mask arrays (type &quot;X&quot;), with the
		  value of BIT being equal to the number of mask bits.
	LOGICAL	= If set, and array is of type byte, then the column is defined
		  as containing logical arrays (type &quot;L&quot;).
	NO_TDIM	= If set, then the TDIMn keyword is not written out to the
		  header.  No TDIMn keywords are written for columns containing
		  variable length arrays.
	TUNIT	= If passed, then corresponding keyword is added to header.
	TSCAL	= Same.
	TZERO	= Same.
	TNULL	= Same.
	TDISP	= Same.
	TDMIN	= Same.
	TDMAX	= Same.
	TDESC	= Same.
	TCUNI	= Same.
	TROTA	= Same.
	TRPIX	= Same.
	TRVAL	= Same.
	TDELT	= Same.
	ERRMSG	= If defined and passed, then any error messages will be
		  returned to the user in this parameter rather than
		  depending on the MESSAGE routine in IDL.  If no errors are
		  encountered, then a null string is returned.  In order to
		  use this feature, ERRMSG must be defined first, e.g.

			ERRMSG = ''
			FXBADDCOL, ERRMSG=ERRMSG, ...
			IF ERRMSG NE '' THEN ...

 Calls       : 
	FXADDPAR, FXPAR
 Common      : 
	None.
 Restrictions: 
	Warning: No checking is done of any of the parameters defining the
	values of optional FITS keywords.

	FXBHMAKE must first be called to initialize the header.

	If ARRAY is of type character, then it must be of the maximum length
	expected for this column.  If a character string array, then the
	largest string in the array is used to determine the maximum length.

	The DCOMPLEX keyword is ignored if ARRAY is not double-precision.
	ARRAY must also have a first dimension of two representing the real and
	imaginary parts.

	The BIT and LOGICAL keywords are ignored if ARRAY is not of type byte.
	BIT takes precedence over LOGICAL.

 Side effects: 
	If the data array is multidimensional, then a TDIM keyword is added to
	the header, unless either NO_TDIM or VARIABLE is set.

	No TDIMn keywords are written out for bit arrays (format 'X'), since
	the dimensions would refer to bits, not bytes.

 NAME: 
	FXBCREATE
 Purpose     : 
	Open a new binary table at the end of a FITS file.
 Explanation : 
	Write a binary table extension header to the end of a disk FITS file,
	and leave it open to receive the data.

	The FITS file is opened, and the pointer is positioned just after the
	last 2880 byte record.  Then the binary header is appended.  Calls to
	FXBWRITE will append the binary data to this file, and then FXBFINISH
	will close the file.

 Use         : 
	FXBCREATE, UNIT, FILENAME, HEADER
 Inputs      : 
	FILENAME = Name of FITS file to be opened.
	HEADER	 = String array containing the FITS binary table extension
		   header.
 Opt. Inputs : 
	None.
 Outputs     : 
	UNIT	 = Logical unit number of the opened file.
       EXTENSION= Extension number of newly created extension.
 Opt. Outputs: 
	None.
 Keywords    : 
	ERRMSG	  = If defined and passed, then any error messages will be
		    returned to the user in this parameter rather than
		    depending on the MESSAGE routine in IDL.  If no errors are
		    encountered, then a null string is returned.  In order to
		    use this feature, ERRMSG must be defined first, e.g.

			ERRMSG = ''
			FXBCREATE, ERRMSG=ERRMSG, ...
			IF ERRMSG NE '' THEN ...

 Calls       : 
	FXADDPAR, FXBFINDLUN, FXBPARSE, FXFINDEND
 Common      : 
	Uses common block FXBINTABLE--see &quot;fxbintable.pro&quot; for more
	information.
 Restrictions: 
	The primary FITS data unit must already be written to a file.  The
	binary table extension header must already be defined (FXBHMAKE), and
	must match the data that will be written to the file.
 Side effects: 
	None.

 NAME:
     FXBDIMEN()

 PURPOSE:      
      Returns the dimensions for a column in a FITS binary table.

 Explanation : This procedure returns the dimensions associated with a column
               in a binary table opened for read with the command FXBOPEN.

 Use         : Result = FXBDIMEN(UNIT,COL)

 Inputs      : UNIT    = Logical unit number returned by FXBOPEN routine.
                         Must be a scalar integer.

               COL     = Column in the binary table to read data from, either
                         as a character string containing a column label
                         (TTYPE), or as a numerical column index starting from
                         column one.

 Opt. Inputs : None.

 Outputs     : The result of the function is an array containing the
               dimensions for the specified column in the FITS binary table
               that UNIT points to.

 Opt. Outputs: None.

 Keywords :    ERRMSG  = If defined and passed, then any error messages will
                         be returned to the user in this parameter rather than
                         depending on the MESSAGE routine in IDL.  If no
                         errors are encountered, then a null string is
                         returned.  In order to use this feature, ERRMSG must
                         be defined first, e.g.

                               ERRMSG = ''
                               Result = FXBDIMEN( ERRMSG=ERRMSG, ... )
                               IF ERRMSG NE '' THEN ...

 Calls       : FXBCOLNUM, FXBFINDLUN

 Common      : Uses common block FXBINTABLE--see &quot;fxbintable.pro&quot; for more
               information.

 Restrictions: None.

 Side effects: The dimensions will be returned whether or not the table is
               still open or not.

               If UNIT does not point to a binary table, then 0 is returned.

               If UNIT is an undefined variable, then 0 is returned.

 NAME: 
	FXBFIND
 Purpose     : 
	Find column keywords in a FITS binary table header.
 Explanation : 
	Finds the value of a column keyword for all the columns in the binary
	table for which it is set.  For example,

		FXBFIND, UNIT, 'TTYPE', COLUMNS, VALUES, N_FOUND

	Would find all instances of the keywords TTYPE1, TTYPE2, etc.  The
	array COLUMNS would contain the column numbers for which a TTYPEn
	keyword was found, and VALUES would contain the values.  N_FOUND would
	contain the total number of instances found.

 Use         : 
	FXBFIND, [UNIT or HEADER], KEYWORD, COLUMNS, VALUES, N_FOUND
		[, DEFAULT ]
 Inputs      : 
	Either UNIT or HEADER must be passed.

	UNIT	= Logical unit number of file opened by FXBOPEN.
	HEADER	= FITS binary table header.
	KEYWORD	= Prefix to a series of FITS binary table column keywords.  The
		  keywords to be searched for are formed by combining this
		  prefix with the numbers 1 through the value of TFIELDS in the
		  header.
 Opt. Inputs : 
	DEFAULT	= Default value to use for any column keywords that aren't
		  found.  If passed, then COLUMNS and VALUES will contain
		  entries for every column.  Otherwise, COLUMNS and VALUES only
		  contain entries for columns where values were found.
 Outputs     : 
	COLUMNS	= Array containing the column numbers for which values of the
		  requested keyword series were found.
	VALUES	= Array containing the found values.
	N_FOUND	= Number of values found.  The value of this parameter is
		  unaffected by whether or not DEFAULT is passed.
 Opt. Outputs: 
	None.
 Output Keywords    : 
      COMMENTS = Comments associated with each keyword, if any
 Calls       : 
	FXBFINDLUN, FXPAR
 Common      : 
	Uses common block FXBINTABLE--see &quot;fxbintable.pro&quot; for more
	information.
 Restrictions: 
	If UNIT is passed, then the file must have been opened with FXBOPEN.
	If HEADER is passed, then it must be a legal FITS binary table header.

	The type of DEFAULT must be consistent with the values of the requested
	keywords, i.e. both most be either of string or numerical type.

	The KEYWORD prefix must not have more than five characters to leave
	room for the three digits allowed for the column numbers.

 Side effects: 
	None.

 NAME: 
        FXBGROW
 PURPOSE     : 
       Increase the number of rows in a binary table.
 EXPLANATION : 
       Call FXBGROW to increase the size of an already-existing FITS
       binary table.  The number of rows increases to NROWS; however
       the table cannot shrink by this operation.  This procedure is
       useful when a table with an unknown number of rows must be
       created.  The caller would then call FXBCREATE to construct a
       table of some base size, and follow with calls to FXBGROW to
       lengthen the table as needed.  The extension being enlarged
       need not be the last extension in the file.  If subsequent
       extensions exist in the file, they will be shifted properly.

 CALLING SEQUENCE :
       FXBGROW, UNIT, HEADER, NROWS[, ERRMSG= , NOZERO= , BUFFERSIZE= ]

 INPUT PARAMETERS :
       UNIT     = Logical unit number of an already-opened file.
       HEADER   = String array containing the FITS binary table extension
                  header.  The header is modified in place.
       NROWS    = New number of rows, always more than the previous
                  number.

 OPTIONAL INPUT KEYWORDS:
       NOZERO   = when set, FXBGROW will not zero-pad the new data if
                  it doesn't have to.
       ERRMSG    = If defined and passed, then any error messages will be
                   returned to the user in this parameter rather than
                   depending on the MESSAGE routine in IDL.  If no errors are
                   encountered, then a null string is returned.  In order to
                   use this feature, ERRMSG must be defined first, e.g.

                       ERRMSG = ''
                       FXBGROW, ERRMSG=ERRMSG, ...
                       IF ERRMSG NE '' THEN ...
       BUFFERSIZE = Size in bytes for intermediate data transfers
                    (default 32768)

 Calls       : 
       FXADDPAR, FXHREAD, BLKSHIFT
 Common      : 
       Uses common block FXBINTABLE--see &quot;fxbintable.pro&quot; for more
       information.
 Restrictions: 
       The file must be open with write permission.

       The binary table extension in question must already by written
       to the file (using FXBCREATE).

       A table can never shrink via this operation.

 SIDE EFFECTS: 
       The FITS file will grow in size, and heap areas are
       preserved by moving them to the end of the file.

       The header is modified to reflect the new number of rows.

 NAME: 
       FXBHEADER()

 PURPOSE: 
       Returns the header of an open FITS binary table.

 EXPLANATION:
      This procedure returns the FITS extension header of a FITS
         binary table opened for read with the command FXBOPEN.

 Use         : Result = FXBHEADER(UNIT)

 Inputs      : UNIT    = Logical unit number returned by FXBOPEN routine.
                         Must be a scalar integer.

 Opt. Inputs : None.

 Outputs     : The result of the function is a string array containing the
               header for the FITS binary table that UNIT points to.

 Opt. Outputs: None.

 Keywords    : None.

 Calls       : FXBFINDLUN

 Common      : Uses common block FXBINTABLE--see &quot;fxbintable.pro&quot; for more
               information.

 Restrictions: None.

 Side effects: The string array returned always has as many elements as the
               largest header read by FXBOPEN.  Any extra elements beyond the
               true header are blank or null strings.

               The header will be returned whether or not the table is still
               open or not.

               If UNIT does not point to a binary table, then a string array
               of nulls is returned.

               If UNIT is an undefined variable, then the null string is
               returned.

 NAME: 
	FXBHMAKE
 Purpose     : 
	Create basic FITS binary table extension (BINTABLE) header.
 Explanation : 
	Creates a basic header array with all the required keywords, but with
	none of the table columns defined.  This defines a basic structure
	which can then be added to or modified by other routines.
 Use         : 
	FXBHMAKE, HEADER, NROWS  [, EXTNAME  [, COMMENT ]]
 Inputs      : 
	NROWS	= Number of rows in the binary table.
 Opt. Inputs : 
	EXTNAME	= If passed, then the EXTNAME record is added with this value.
	COMMENT = Comment to go along with EXTNAME.
 Outputs     : 
	HEADER = String array containing FITS extension header.
 Opt. Outputs: 
	None.
 Keywords    : 
	INITIALIZE = If set, then the header is completely initialized, and any
		     previous entries are lost.
	DATE	   = If set, then the DATE keyword is added to the header.
	EXTVER	   = Extension version number (integer).
	EXTLEVEL   = Extension level number (integer).
	ERRMSG	   = If defined and passed, then any error messages will be
		     returned to the user in this parameter rather than
		     depending on the MESSAGE routine in IDL.  If no errors are
		     encountered, then a null string is returned.  In order to
		     use this feature, ERRMSG must be defined first, e.g.

			ERRMSG = ''
			FXBHMAKE, ERRMSG=ERRMSG, ...
			IF ERRMSG NE '' THEN ...

 NAME: 
	FXBINTABLE
 Purpose     : 
	Common block FXBINTABLE used by &quot;FXB&quot; routines.
 Explanation : 
	This is not an IDL routine as such, but contains the definition of the
	common block FXBINTABLE for inclusion into other routines.  By defining
	the common block in one place, the problem of conflicting definitions
	is avoided.

	This file is included into routines that need this common block with
	the single line (left justified)

				  @fxbintable

	FXBINTABLE contains the following arrays:

		LUN	= An array of logical unit numbers of currently (or
			  previously) opened binary table files.
		STATE	= Array containing the state of the FITS files
			  associated with the logical unit numbers, where
			  0=closed, 1=open for read, and 2=open for write.
		HEAD	= FITS binary table headers.
		MHEADER	= Array containing the positions of the first data byte
			  of the header for each file referenced by array LUN.
		NHEADER	= Array containing the positions of the first data byte
			  after the header for each file referenced by array
			  LUN.
		NAXIS1	= Values of NAXIS1 from the binary table headers.
		NAXIS2	= Values of NAXIS2 from the binary table headers.
		TFIELDS	= Values of TFIELDS from the binary table headers.
		HEAP	= The start of the first byte of the heap area
			  for variable length arrays.
		DHEAP	= The start of the first byte of the next variable
			  length array, if writing.
		BYTOFF	= Byte offset from the beginning of the row for each
			  column in the binary table headers.
		TTYPE	= Values of TTYPE for each column in the binary table
			  headers.
		FORMAT	= Character code formats of the various columns.
		IDLTYPE	= IDL type code for each column in the binary table
			  headers.
		N_ELEM	= Number of elements for each column in the binary
			  table headers.
		TSCAL	= Scale factors for the individual columns.
		TZERO	= Zero offsets for the individual columns.
		MAXVAL	= For variable length arrays, contains the maximum
			  number of elements for each column in the binary
			  table headers.
		N_DIMS	= Number of dimensions, and array of dimensions for
			  each column of type string in the binary table
			  headers.

 NAME: 
       FXBISOPEN()

 PURPOSE: 
       Returns true if UNIT points to an open FITS binary table.

 Explanation : This procedure checks to see if the logical unit number given
               by the variable UNIT corresponds to a FITS binary table opened
               for read with the command FXBOPEN, and which has not yet been
               closed with FXBCLOSE.

 Use         : Result = FXBISOPEN(UNIT)

               If FXBISOPEN(UNIT) THEN ...

 Inputs      : UNIT    = Logical unit number returned by FXBOPEN routine.
                         Must be a scalar integer.

 Opt. Inputs : None.

 Outputs     : The result of the function is either True (1) or False (0),
               depending on whether UNIT points to an open binary table or
               not.

 Opt. Outputs: None.

 Keywords    : None.

 Calls       : FXBFINDLUN

 Common      : Uses common block FXBINTABLE--see &quot;fxbintable.pro&quot; for more
               information.

 Restrictions: None.

 Side effects: If UNIT is an undefined variable, then False (0) is returned.

               If UNIT points to a FITS binary table file that is opened for
               write, then False (0) is returned.

 NAME: 
	FXBOPEN
 Purpose     : 
	Open binary table extension in a disk FITS file for reading or updating
 Explanation : 
	Opens a binary table extension in a disk FITS file for reading.  The
	columns are then read using FXBREAD, and the file is closed when done
	with FXBCLOSE.
 Use         : 
	FXBOPEN, UNIT, FILENAME, EXTENSION  [, HEADER ]
 Inputs      : 
       FILENAME  = Name of FITS file to be opened.  Optional
                   extension *number* may be specified, in either of
                   the following formats (using the FTOOLS
                   convention): FILENAME[EXT] or FILENAME+EXT, where
                   EXT is 1 or higher.  Such an extension
                   specification takes priority over EXTENSION.
                
	EXTENSION = Either the number of the FITS extension, starting with the
		    first extension after the primary data unit being one; or a
		    character string containing the value of EXTNAME to search
		    for.
 Opt. Inputs : 
	None.
 Outputs     : 
	UNIT	  = Logical unit number of the opened file.
 Opt. Outputs: 
	HEADER	  = String array containing the FITS binary table extension
		    header.
 Keywords    : 
	NO_TDIM	  = If set, then any TDIMn keywords found in the header are
		    ignored.

       ACCESS    = A scalar string describing access privileges as
                   one of READ ('R') or UPDATE ('RW').
                   DEFAULT: 'R'

       REOPEN    = If set, UNIT must be an already-opened file unit.
                   FXBOPEN will treat the file as a FITS file.

	ERRMSG	  = If defined and passed, then any error messages will be
		    returned to the user in this parameter rather than
		    depending on the MESSAGE routine in IDL.  If no errors are
		    encountered, then a null string is returned.  In order to
		    use this feature, ERRMSG must be defined first, e.g.

			ERRMSG = ''
			FXBOPEN, ERRMSG=ERRMSG, ...

 NAME: 
	FXBREAD
 Purpose     : 
	Read a data array from a disk FITS binary table file.
 Explanation : 
	Each call to FXBREAD will read the data from one column and one row
	from the FITS data file, which should already have been opened by
	FXBOPEN.  One needs to call this routine for every column and every row
	in the binary table.  FXBCLOSE will then close the FITS data file.
 Use         : 
	FXBREAD, UNIT, DATA, COL  [, ROW ]
 Inputs      : 
	UNIT	= Logical unit number corresponding to the file containing the
		  binary table.
	COL	= Column in the binary table to read data from, either as a
		  character string containing a column label (TTYPE), or as a
		  numerical column index starting from column one.
 Opt. Inputs : 
	ROW	= Either row number in the binary table to read data from,
		  starting from row one, or a two element array containing a
		  range of row numbers to read.  If not passed, then the entire
		  column is read in.

		  Row must be passed for variable length arrays.

 Outputs     : 
	DATA	= IDL data array to be read from the file.
 Opt. Outputs: 
	None.
 Keywords    : 
	NOSCALE	= If set, then the output data will not be scaled using the
		  optional TSCAL and TZERO keywords in the FITS header.
		  Default is to scale.
       NOIEEE  = If set, then the output data is not byte-swapped to 
                 machine order.  NOIEEE implies NOSCALE.
                 Default is to perform the byte-swap.
	VIRTUAL	= If set, and COL is passed as a name rather than a number,
		  then if the program can't find a column with that name, it
		  will then look for a keyword with that name in the header.
		  Such a keyword would then act as a &quot;virtual column&quot;, with the
		  same value for every row.
	DIMENSIONS = Vector array containing the dimensions to be used to read
		  in the data.  Bypasses any dimensioning information stored in
		  the header.  Ignored for bit arrays.  If the data type is
		  double-precision complex, then an extra dimension of 2 is
		  prepended to the dimensions passed by the user.
	NANVALUE= Value signalling data dropout.  All points corresponding to
		  IEEE NaN (not-a-number) are converted to this number.
		  Ignored unless DATA is of type float, double-precision or
		  complex.
	ERRMSG	= If defined and passed, then any error messages will be
		  returned to the user in this parameter rather than
		  depending on the MESSAGE routine in IDL.  If no errors are
		  encountered, then a null string is returned.  In order to
		  use this feature, ERRMSG must be defined first, e.g.

			ERRMSG = ''
			FXBREAD, ERRMSG=ERRMSG, ...
			IF ERRMSG NE '' THEN ...

 Calls       : 
	FXPAR, WHERE_NEGZERO, WHERENAN
 Common      : 
	Uses common block FXBINTABLE--see &quot;fxbintable.pro&quot; for more
	information.
 Restrictions: 
	The binary table file must have been opened with FXBOPEN.

	The data must be consistent with the column definition in the binary
	table header.

	The row number must be consistent with the number of rows stored in the
	binary table header.

	The number of elements implied by the dimensions keyword must not
	exceed the number of elements stored in the file.

 Side effects: 
	If the DIMENSIONS keyword is used, then the number of data points read
	in may be less than the number of points stored in the table.

	If there are no elements to read in (the number of elements is zero),
	then the program sets !ERR to -1, and DATA is unmodified.

 NAME:
       FXBREADM
 PURPOSE: 
       Read multiple columns/rows from a disk FITS binary table file.
 EXPLANATION : 
       A call to FXBREADM will read data from multiple rows and
       multiple columns in a single procedure call.  Up to forty-nine
       columns may be read in a single pass; the number of rows is
       limited essentially by available memory.  The file should have
       already been opened with FXBOPEN.  FXBREADM optimizes reading
       multiple columns by first reading a large chunk of data from
       the FITS file directly, and then slicing the data into columns
       within memory.  FXBREADM can read variable-length arrays (see
       below).

       The number of columns is limited to 49 if data are passed by
       positional argument.  However, this limitation can be overcome
       by having FXBREADM return the data in an array of pointers.
       The user should set the PASS_METHOD keyword to 'POINTER', and an 
       array of pointers to the data will be returned in the POINTERS keyword.
       The  user is responsible for freeing the pointers; however,
       FXBREADM will reuse any pointers  passed into the procedure, and 
       hence any pointed-to data will be destroyed.

       FXBREADM can also read variable-length columns from FITS
       binary tables.  Since such data is not of a fixed size, it is
       returned as a structure.  The structure has the following
       elements:

              VARICOL:    ;; Flag: variable length column (= 1)
              N_ELEMENTS: ;; Total number of elements returned
              TYPE:       ;; IDL data type code (integer)
              N_ROWS:     ;; Number of rows read from table (integer)
              INDICES:    ;; Indices of each row's data (integer array)
              DATA:       ;; Raw data elements (variable type array)

       In order to gain access to the Ith row's data, one should
       examine DATA(INDICES(I):INDICES(I+1)-1), which is similar in
       construct to the REVERSE_INDICES keyword of the HISTOGRAM
       function.

 CALLING SEQUENCE: 
       FXBREADM, UNIT, COL, DATA1, [ DATA2, ... DATA48, ROW=, BUFFERSIZE = ]
           /NOIEEE, /NOSCALE, /VIRTUAL, NANVALUE=, PASS_METHOD = POINTERS=, 
           ERRMSG = , WARNMSG = , STATUS = , /DEFAULT_FLOAT]

 INPUT PARAMETERS : 
       UNIT    = Logical unit number corresponding to the file containing the
                 binary table.
       COL     = An array of columns in the binary table to read data
                 from, either as character strings containing column
                 labels (TTYPE), or as numerical column indices
                 starting from column one.
 Outputs     : 
       DATA1, DATA2...DATA48 = A named variable to accept the data values, one
                 for each column.  The columns are stored in order of the
                 list in COL.  If the read operation fails for a
                 particular column, then the corresponding output Dn
                 variable is not altered.  See the STATUS keyword.
                 Ignored if PASS_METHOD is 'POINTER'.

 OPTIONAL INPUT KEYWORDS: 
       ROW     = Either row number in the binary table to read data from,
                 starting from row one, or a two element array containing a
                 range of row numbers to read.  If not passed, then the entire
                 column is read in.
       /DEFAULT_FLOAT = If set, then scaling with TSCAL/TZERO is done with
                 floating point rather than double precision.
       /NOIEEE = If set, then then IEEE floating point data will not
                be converted to the host floating point format (and
                this by definition implies NOSCALE).  The user is
                responsible for their own floating point conversion.
       /NOSCALE = If set, then the output data will not be scaled using the
                 optional TSCAL and TZERO keywords in the FITS header.
                 Default is to scale.
       VIRTUAL = If set, and COL is passed as a name rather than a number,
                 then if the program can't find a column with that name, it
                 will then look for a keyword with that name in the header.
                 Such a keyword would then act as a &quot;virtual column&quot;, with the
                 same value for every row.
       DIMENSIONS = FXBREADM ignores this keyword.  It is here for
	          compatibility only.
       NANVALUE= Value signalling data dropout.  All points corresponding to
                 IEEE NaN (not-a-number) are converted to this number.
                 Ignored unless DATA is of type float, double-precision or
                 complex.
       PASS_METHOD = A scalar string indicating method of passing
                 data from FXBREADM.  Either 'ARGUMENT' (indicating
                 pass by positional argument), or 'POINTER' (indicating
                 passing an array of pointers by the POINTERS
                 keyword).
                 Default: 'ARGUMENT'
       POINTERS = If PASS_METHOD is 'POINTER' then an array of IDL
                 pointers is returned in this keyword, one for each
                 requested column.    Any pointers passed into FXBREADM will 
                 have their pointed-to data destroyed.  Ultimately the
                 user is responsible for deallocating pointers. 
       BUFFERSIZE = Raw data are transferred from the file in chunks
                 to conserve memory.  This is the size in bytes of
                 each chunk.  If a value of zero is given, then all
                 of the data are transferred in one pass.  Default is
                 32768 (32 kB).
 OPTIONAL OUTPUT KEYWORDS:
       ERRMSG  = If defined and passed, then any error messages will be
                 returned to the user in this parameter rather than
                 depending on the MESSAGE routine in IDL.  If no errors are
                 encountered, then a null string is returned.  In order to
                 use this feature, ERRMSG must be defined first, e.g.

                       ERRMSG = ''
                       FXBREAD, ERRMSG=ERRMSG, ...
                       IF ERRMSG NE '' THEN ...
       WARNMSG = Messages which are considered to be non-fatal
                 &quot;warnings&quot; are returned in this output string.
                 Note that if some but not all columns are
                 unreadable, this is considered to be non-fatal.
       STATUS  = An output array containing the status for each
                 column read, 1 meaning success and 0 meaning failure.

 Calls       : 
       FXPAR(), WHERENAN()
 Common      : 
       Uses common block FXBINTABLE--see &quot;fxbintable.pro&quot; for more
       information.
 Restrictions: 
       The binary table file must have been opened with FXBOPEN.

       The data must be consistent with the column definition in the binary
       table header.

       The row number must be consistent with the number of rows stored in the
       binary table header.

       Generally speaking, FXBREADM will be faster than iterative
       calls to FXBREAD when (a) a large number of columns is to be
       read or (b) the size in bytes of each cell is small, so that
       the overhead of the FOR loop in FXBREAD becomes significant.

 SIDE EFFECTS: 
       If there are no elements to read in (the number of elements is zero),
       then the program sets !ERR to -1, and DATA is unmodified.

 NAME: 
      FXBSTATE()

 PURPOSE:
       Returns the state of a FITS binary table.

 Explanation : This procedure returns the state of a FITS binary table that
               was either opened for read with the command FXBOPEN, or for
               write with the command FXBCREATE.

 Use         : Result = FXBSTATE(UNIT)

 Inputs      : UNIT    = Logical unit number returned by FXBOPEN routine.
                         Must be a scalar integer.

 Opt. Inputs : None.

 Outputs     : The result of the function is the state of the FITS binary
               table that UNIT points to.  This can be one of three values:

                       0 = Closed
                       1 = Open for read
                       2 = Open for write

 Opt. Outputs: None.

 Keywords    : None.

 Calls       : FXBFINDLUN

 Common      : Uses common block FXBINTABLE--see &quot;fxbintable.pro&quot; for more
               information.

 Restrictions: None.

 Side effects: If UNIT is an undefined variable, then 0 (closed) is returned.

 NAME: 
	FXBWRITM
 PURPOSE: 
       Write multiple columns/rows to a disk FITS binary table file.
 EXPLANATION : 
       A call to FXBWRITM will write multiple rows and multiple
       columns to a binary table in a single procedure call.  Up to
       fifty columns may be read in a single pass.  The file should
       have already been opened with FXBOPEN (with write access) or
       FXBCREATE.  FXBWRITM optimizes writing multiple columns by
       first writing a large chunk of data to the FITS file all at
       once.  FXBWRITM cannot write variable-length arrays; use
       FXBWRITE instead.

       The number of columns is limited to 50 if data are passed by
       positional argument.  However, this limitation can be overcome
       by passing pointers to FXBWRITM.  The user should set the PASS_METHOD 
       keyword to 'POINTER'  as appropriate, and  an array of pointers to 
       the data in the POINTERS keyword.  The user is responsible for freeing 
        the pointers.

 CALLING SEQUENCE: 
	FXBWRITM, UNIT, COL, D0, D1, D2, ..., [ ROW= , PASS_METHOD, NANVALUE=
                               POINTERS=,  BUFFERSIZE= ]
    
 INPUT PARAMETERS: 
	UNIT	= Logical unit number corresponding to the file containing the
		  binary table.
	D0,..D49= An IDL data array to be written to the file, one for
                 each column.      These parameters will be igonred if data
                 is passed through the POINTERS keyword.
	COL	= Column in the binary table to place data in.   May be either
                 a list of column numbers where the first column is one, or 
                 a string list of column names.  

 OPTIONAL INPUT KEYWORDS: 
	ROW	= Either row number in the binary table to write data to,
		  starting from row one, or a two element array containing a
		  range of row numbers to write.  If not passed, then
		  the entire column is written.
	NANVALUE= Value signalling data dropout.  All points corresponding to
		  this value are set to be IEEE NaN (not-a-number).  Ignored
		  unless DATA is of type float, double-precision or complex.
       NOSCALE = If set, then TSCAL/TZERO values are ignored, and data is 
                 written exactly as supplied. 
       PASS_METHOD = A scalar string indicating method of passing
                 data to FXBWRITM.  One of 'ARGUMENT' (indicating
                 pass by positional argument),  or'POINTER' (indicating
                 passing an array of pointers by the POINTERS
                 keyword).  
                 Default:  'ARGUMENT'
       POINTERS = If PASS_METHOD is 'POINTER' then the user must pass
                 an array of IDL pointers to this keyword, one for
                 each column.    Ultimately the user is responsible for 
                 deallocating pointers.
       BUFFERSIZE = Data are transferred in chunks to conserve
                 memory.  This is the size in bytes of each chunk.
                 If a value of zero is given, then all of the data
                 are transferred in one pass.  Default is 32768 (32
                 kB).
 OPTIONAL OUTPUT KEYWORDS:
	ERRMSG	= If defined and passed, then any error messages will be
		  returned to the user in this parameter rather than
		  depending on the MESSAGE routine in IDL.  If no errors are
		  encountered, then a null string is returned.  In order to
		  use this feature, ERRMSG must be defined first, e.g.

			ERRMSG = ''
			FXBWRITE, ERRMSG=ERRMSG, ...
			IF ERRMSG NE '' THEN ...
       WARNMSG = Messages which are considered to be non-fatal
                 &quot;warnings&quot; are returned in this  output string.
       STATUS  = An output array containing the status for each
                 read, 1 meaning success and 0 meaning failure.

 PROCEDURE CALLS: 
      None.
 EXAMPLE:
      Write a binary table 'sample.fits' giving 43 X,Y positions and a 
      21 x 21 PSF at each position:

      (1) First, create sample values
      x = findgen(43) &amp; y = findgen(43)+1 &amp; psf = randomn(seed,21,21,43)
      
      (2) Create primary header, write it to disk, and make extension header
      fxhmake,header,/initialize,/extend,/date
      fxwrite,'sample.fits',header
      fxbhmake,header,43,'TESTEXT','Test binary table extension'

      (3) Fill extension header with desired column names
      fxbaddcol,1,header,x[0],'X'             ;Use first element in each array
      fxbaddcol,2,header,y[0],'Y'             ;to determine column properties
      fxbaddcol,3,header,psf[*,*,0],'PSF'

      (4) Write extension header to FITS file
      fxbcreate,unit,'sample.fits',header

      (5) Use FXBWRITM to write all data to the extension in a single call
      fxbwritm,unit,['X','Y','PSF'], x, y, psf
      fxbfinish,unit                 ;Close the file

 COMMON BLOCKS: 
	Uses common block FXBINTABLE--see &quot;fxbintable.pro&quot; for more
	information.
 RESTRICTIONS: 
	The binary table file must have been opened with FXBCREATE or
       FXBOPEN (with write access).

	The data must be consistent with the column definition in the binary
	table header.

	The row number must be consistent with the number of rows stored in the
	binary table header.

       A PASS_METHOD of POINTER does not use the EXECUTE() statement and can be
       used with the IDL Virtual Machine.   However, the EXECUTE() statement is
       used when the PASS_METHOD is by arguments.

 NAME: 
	FXFINDEND
 Purpose     : 
	Find the end of a FITS file.
 Explanation : 
	This routine finds the end of the last logical record in a FITS file,
	which may be different from that of the physical end of the file.  Each
	FITS header is read in and parsed, and the file pointer is moved to
	where the next FITS extension header would be if there is one, or to
	the end of the file if not.
 Use         : 
	FXFINDEND, UNIT [, EXTENSION]
 Inputs      : 
	UNIT	= Logical unit number for the opened file.
 Opt. Inputs : 
	None.
 Outputs     : 
	None.
 Opt. Outputs: 
       EXTENSION = The extension number that a new extension would
                   have if placed at the end of the file.
 Keywords    : 
	None.
 Calls       : 
	FXHREAD, FXPAR
 Common      :

 NAME: 
	FXHMAKE
 Purpose     : 
	Create a basic FITS header array.
 Explanation : 
	Creates a basic header array with all the required keywords.  This
	defines a basic structure which can then be added to or modified by
	other routines.
 Use         : 
	FXHMAKE, HEADER  [, DATA ]
 Inputs      : 
	None required.
 Opt. Inputs : 
	DATA	= IDL data array to be written to file.    It must be in the 
                  primary data unit unless the XTENSION keyword is supplied.
		  This array is used to determine the values of the BITPIX and 
                 NAXIS, etc. keywords.

		  If not passed, then BITPIX is set to eight, NAXIS is set to
		  zero, and no NAXISnnn keywords are included in this
		  preliminary header.
 Outputs     : 
	HEADER = String array containing FITS header.
 Opt. Outputs: 
	None.
 Keywords    : 
	INITIALIZE = If set, then the header is completely initialized, and any
		     previous entries are lost.
	EXTEND	= If set, then the keyword EXTEND is inserted into the file,
		  with the value of &quot;T&quot; (true).
	DATE	= If set, then the DATE keyword is added to the header.
	ERRMSG	= If defined and passed, then any error messages will be
		  returned to the user in this parameter rather than
		  depending on the MESSAGE routine in IDL.  If no errors are
		  encountered, then a null string is returned.  In order to
		  use this feature, ERRMSG must be defined first, e.g.

			ERRMSG = ''
			FXHMAKE, ERRMSG=ERRMSG, ...
			IF ERRMSG NE '' THEN ...
       XTENSION - If set, then the header is appropriate for an image 
                  extension, rather than the primary data unit.
 Calls       : 
	GET_DATE, FXADDPAR, FXHCLEAN
 Common      : 
	None.
 Restrictions: 
	Groups are not currently supported.
 Side effects: 
	BITPIX, NAXIS, etc. are defined such that complex arrays are stored as
	floating point, with an extra first dimension of two elements (real and
	imaginary parts).
 Category    : 
	Data Handling, I/O, FITS, Generic.
 Prev. Hist. : 
	William Thompson, Jan 1992, from SXHMAKE by D. Lindler and M. Greason.
	Differences include:

		* Use of FITS standard (negative BITPIX) to signal floating
		  point numbers instead of (SDAS/Geis) DATATYPE keyword.
		* Storage of complex numbers as pairs of real numbers.
		* Support for EXTEND keyword, and for cases where there is no
		  primary data array.
		* Insertion of DATE record made optional.  Only required FITS
		  keywords are inserted automatically.

 NAME: 
       FXHMODIFY
 PURPOSE     : 
       Modify a FITS header in a file on disk.
 Explanation : 
       Opens a FITS file, and adds or modifies a parameter in the FITS header.
       Can be used for either the main header, or for an extension header. 
       The modification is performed directly on the disk file.
 Use         : 
       FXHMODIFY, FILENAME, NAME, VALUE, COMMENT
 Inputs      : 
       FILENAME = String containing the name of the file to be read.

       NAME    = Name of parameter, scalar string  If NAME is already in the 
                 header the value and possibly comment fields are modified. 
                 Otherwise a new record is added to the header.  If NAME is 
                 equal to either &quot;COMMENT&quot; or &quot;HISTORY&quot; then the value will be 
                 added to the record without replacement.  In this case the 
                 comment parameter is ignored.

       VALUE   = Value for parameter.  The value expression must be of the
                 correct type, e.g. integer, floating or string.  String
                 values of 'T' or 'F' are considered logical values.

 Opt. Inputs : 
       COMMENT = String field.  The '/' is added by this routine.  Added
                 starting in position 31.  If not supplied, or set equal to ''
                 (the null string), then any previous comment field in the
                 header for that keyword is retained (when found).
 Outputs     : 
       None.
 Opt. Outputs: 
       None.
 Keywords    : 
       EXTENSION = Either the number of the FITS extension, starting with the
                   first extension after the primary data unit being one; or a
                   character string containing the value of EXTNAME to search
                   for.  If not passed, then the primary FITS header is
                   modified.           

       BEFORE  = Keyword string name.  The parameter will be placed before the
                 location of this keyword.  For example, if BEFORE='HISTORY'
                 then the parameter will be placed before the first history
                 location.  This applies only when adding a new keyword;
                 keywords already in the header are kept in the same position.

       AFTER   = Same as BEFORE, but the parameter will be placed after the
                 location of this keyword.  This keyword takes precedence over
                 BEFORE.

       FORMAT  = Specifies FORTRAN-like format for parameter, e.g. &quot;F7.3&quot;.  A
                 scalar string should be used.  For complex numbers the format
                 should be defined so that it can be applied separately to the
                 real and imaginary parts.
       ERRMSG  = If defined and passed, then any error messages will be
                 returned to the user in this parameter rather than
                 depending on the MESSAGE routine in IDL.  If no errors are
                 encountered, then a null string is returned.  In order to
                 use this feature, ERRMSG must be defined first, e.g.

                       ERRMSG = ''
                       FXHMODIFY, ERRMSG=ERRMSG, ...
                       IF ERRMSG NE '' THEN ...

       NEW_HEADER = If defined and passed, then ignore NAME, VALUE,
                    and COMMENT. Instead replace the old file header
                    with the strarr given.

 Calls       : 
       FXHREAD, FXPAR, FXADDPAR, BLKSHIFT
 Restrictions: 
       This routine can not be used to modify any of the keywords that control
       the structure of the FITS file, e.g. BITPIX, NAXIS, PCOUNT, etc.  Doing
       so could corrupt the readability of the FITS file.
 Example:
       Modify the name 'OBJECT' keyword in the primary FITS header of a FITS 
       file 'spec98.ccd' to contain the value 'test domeflat'

       IDL&gt; fxhmodify, 'spec98.ccd', 'OBJECT', 'test domeflat'

 Side effects: 
       If adding a record to the FITS header would increase the
       number of 2880 byte records stored on disk, then the file is
       enlarged before modification, unless the NOGROW keyword is passed.

 NAME: 
        FXPAR()
 PURPOSE: 
       Obtain the value of a parameter in a FITS header.
 EXPLANATION: 
       The first 8 chacters of each element of HDR are searched for a match to
       NAME.  If the keyword is one of those allowed to take multiple values
       (&quot;HISTORY&quot;, &quot;COMMENT&quot;, or &quot;        &quot; (blank)), then the value is taken
       as the next 72 characters.  Otherwise, it is assumed that the next
       character is &quot;=&quot;, and the value (and optional comment) is then parsed
       from the last 71 characters.  An error occurs if there is no parameter
       with the given name.
      
       If the value is too long for one line, it may be continued on to the
       the next input card, using the CONTINUE Long String Keyword convention.
       For more info, http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/registry/continue_keyword.html
       

       Complex numbers are recognized as two numbers separated by one or more
       space characters.

       If a numeric value has no decimal point (or E or D) it is returned as
       type LONG.  If it contains more than 8 numerals, or contains the
       character 'D', then it is returned as type DOUBLE.  Otherwise it is
       returned as type FLOAT.    If an integer is too large to be stored as
       type LONG, then it is returned as DOUBLE.

       If a keyword is in the header and has no value, then the default
       missing value is returned as explained below.  This can be
       distinguished from the case where the keyword is not found by the fact
       that COUNT=0 in that case, while existing keywords without a value will
       be returned with COUNT=1 or more.

 CALLING SEQUENCE: 
       Result = FXPAR( HDR, NAME  [, ABORT, COUNT=, COMMENT=, /NOCONTINUE ] )

       Result = FXPAR(HEADER,'DATE')           ;Finds the value of DATE
       Result = FXPAR(HEADER,'NAXIS*')         ;Returns array dimensions as
                                               ;vector
 REQUIRED INPUTS: 
       HDR     = FITS header string array (e.g. as returned by FXREAD).  Each
                 element should have a length of 80 characters
       NAME    = String name of the parameter to return.  If NAME is of the
                 form 'keyword*' then an array is returned containing values
                 of keywordN where N is an integer.  The value of keywordN
                 will be placed in RESULT(N-1).  The data type of RESULT will
                 be the type of the first valid match of keywordN
                 found, unless DATATYPE is given.
 OPTIONAL INPUT: 
       ABORT   = String specifying that FXPAR should do a RETALL if a
                 parameter is not found.  ABORT should contain a string to be
                 printed if the keyword parameter is not found.  If not
                 supplied, FXPAR will return with a negative !err if a keyword
                 is not found.
 OUTPUT: 
       The returned value of the function is the value(s) associated with the
       requested keyword in the header array.

       If the parameter is complex, double precision, floating point, long or
       string, then the result is of that type.  Apostrophes are stripped from
       strings.  If the parameter is logical, 1 is returned for T, and 0 is
       returned for F.

       If NAME was of form 'keyword*' then a vector of values are returned.

 OPTIONAL INPUT KEYWORDS: 
       DATATYPE = A scalar value, indicating the type of vector
                  data.  All keywords will be cast to this type.
                  Default: based on first keyword.
                  Example: DATATYPE=0.0D (cast data to double precision)
       START   = A best-guess starting position of the sought-after
                 keyword in the header.  If specified, then FXPAR
                 first searches for scalar keywords in the header in
                 the index range bounded by START-PRECHECK and
                 START+POSTCHECK.  This can speed up keyword searches
                 in large headers.  If the keyword is not found, then
                 FXPAR searches the entire header.  

                 If not specified then the entire header is searched.
                 Searches of the form 'keyword*' also search the
                 entire header and ignore START.

                 Upon return START is changed to be the position of
                 the newly found keyword.  Thus the best way to
                 search for a series of keywords is to search for
                 them in the order they appear in the header like
                 this:

                       START = 0L
                       P1 = FXPAR('P1', START=START)
                       P2 = FXPAR('P2', START=START)

       PRECHECK = If START is specified, then PRECHECK is the number
                  of keywords preceding START to be searched.
                  Default: 5
       POSTCHECK = If START is specified, then POSTCHECK is the number
                   of keywords after START to be searched.
                   Default: 20
       /NOCONTINUE = If set, then continuation lines will not be read, even
                 if present in the header
       MISSING = By default, this routine returns 0 when keyword values are
                 not found.  This can be overridden by using the MISSING
                 keyword, e.g. MISSING=-1.
       /NAN    = If set, then return Not-a-Number (!values.f_nan) for missing
                 values.  Ignored if keyword MISSING is present.
       /NULL   = If set, then return !NULL (undefined) for missing values.
                 Ignored if MISSING or /NAN is present, or if earlier than IDL
                 version 8.0.  If multiple values would be returned, then
                 MISSING= or /NAN should be used instead of /NULL, making sure
                 that the datatype is consistent with the non-missing values,
                 e.g. MISSING='' for strings, MISSING=-1 for integers, or
                 MISSING=-1.0 or /NAN for floating point.  /NAN should not be
                 used if the datatype would otherwise be integer.
       /MULTIVALUE = Allow multiple values to be returned, if found in the
                     header.
 OPTIONAL OUTPUT KEYWORD:
       COUNT   = Optional keyword to return a value equal to the number of
                 parameters found by FXPAR.
       COMMENTS= Array of comments associated with the returned values.

 PROCEDURE CALLS: 
       GETTOK(), VALID_NUM
 SIDE EFFECTS: 

       The system variable !err is set to -1 if parameter not found, 0 for a
       scalar value returned.  If a vector is returned it is set to the number
       of keyword matches found.    This use of !ERR is deprecated.

       If a keyword occurs more than once in a header, a warning is given,
       and the first occurence is used.  However, if the keyword is &quot;HISTORY&quot;,
       &quot;COMMENT&quot;, or &quot;        &quot; (blank), then multiple values are returned.

 NOTES:
	The functions SXPAR() and FXPAR() are nearly identical, although
	FXPAR() has slightly more sophisticated parsing.   There is no
	particular reason for having two nearly identical procedures, but
	both are too widely used to drop either one.

 REVISION HISTORY: 
       Version 1, William Thompson, GSFC, 12 April 1993.
               Adapted from SXPAR
       Version 2, William Thompson, GSFC, 14 October 1994
               Modified to use VALID_NUM instead of STRNUMBER.  Inserted
               additional call to VALID_NUM to trap cases where character
               strings did not contain quotation marks.
       Version 3, William Thompson, GSFC, 22 December 1994
               Fixed bug with blank keywords, following suggestion by Wayne
               Landsman.
       Version 4, Mons Morrison, LMSAL, 9-Jan-98
               Made non-trailing ' for string tag just be a warning (not
               a fatal error).  It was needed because &quot;sxaddpar&quot; had an
               error which did not write tags properly for long strings
               (over 68 characters)
       Version 5, Wayne Landsman GSFC, 29 May 1998
               Fixed potential problem with overflow of LONG values
       Version 6, Craig Markwardt, GSFC, 28 Jan 1998, 
               Added CONTINUE parsing         
       Version 7, Craig Markwardt, GSFC, 18 Nov 1999,
               Added START, PRE/POSTCHECK keywords for better
               performance
       Version 8, Craig Markwardt, GSFC, 08 Oct 2003,
               Added DATATYPE keyword to cast vector keywords type
       Version 9, Paul Hick, 22 Oct 2003, Corrected bug (NHEADER-1)
       Version 10, W. Landsman, GSFC  2 May 2012
               Keywords of form &quot;name_0&quot; could confuse vector extractions
       Version 11 W. Landsman, GSFC 24 Apr 2014
               Don't convert LONG64 numbers to to double precision
       Version 12, William Thompson, 13-Aug-2014
               Add keywords MISSING, /NAN, and /NULL
	Version 13, W. Landsman 25-Jan-2018
		Return ULONG64 integer if LONG64 would overflow
       Version 14, William Thompson, 03-Jun-2019
               Add /MULTIVALUE keyword
       Version 15, Mats Löfdahl, 11-Sep-2019
               Read CONTINUE mechanism multi-line comments.

 NAME: 
	FXPARPOS()
 Purpose     : 
	Finds position to insert record into FITS header.
 Explanation : 
	Finds the position to insert a record into a FITS header.  Called from
	FXADDPAR.
 Use         : 
	Result = FXPARPOS(KEYWRD, IEND  [, BEFORE=BEFORE ]  [, AFTER=AFTER ])
 Inputs      : 
	KEYWRD	= Array of eight-character keywords in header.
	IEND	= Position of END keyword.
 Opt. Inputs : 
	None.
 Outputs     : 
	Result of function is position to insert record.
 Opt. Outputs: 
	None.
 Keywords    : 
	BEFORE	= Keyword string name.  The parameter will be placed before the
		  location of this keyword.  For example, if BEFORE='HISTORY'
		  then the parameter will be placed before the first history
		  location.  This applies only when adding a new keyword;
		  keywords already in the header are kept in the same position.

	AFTER	= Same as BEFORE, but the parameter will be placed after the
		  location of this keyword.  This keyword takes precedence over
		  BEFORE.

       LAST    = The parameter will be placed just after the last keyword
                 which is not a blank, COMMENT, or HISTORY record.  Both the
                 BEFORE and AFTER keywords take precedence over LAST.

	If none of the BEFORE, AFTER, or LAST keywords are passed, then IEND is
	returned.

 Calls       : 
	None.
 Common      : 
	None.
 Restrictions: 
	KEYWRD and IEND must be consistent with the relevant FITS header.
 Side effects: 
	None.

 NAME: 
	FXREAD
 Purpose     : 
	Read basic FITS files.
 Explanation : 
	Read an image array from a disk FITS file.  Optionally allows the
	user to read in only a subarray and/or every Nth pixel.
 Use         : 
	FXREAD, FILENAME, DATA  [, HEADER  [, I1, I2  [, J1, J2 ]]  [, STEP]]
 Inputs      : 
	FILENAME = String containing the name of the file to be read.
 Opt. Inputs : 
	I1,I2	 = Data range to read in the first dimension.  If passed, then
		   HEADER must also be passed.  If not passed, or set to -1,-1,
		   then the entire range is read.
	J1,J2	 = Data range to read in the second dimension.  If passed, then
		   HEADER and I1,J2 must also be passed.  If not passed, or set
		   to -1,-1, then the entire range is read.
	STEP	 = Step size to use in reading the data.  If passed, then
		   HEADER must also be passed.  Default value is 1.  Ignored if
		   less than 1.
 Outputs     : 
	DATA	 = Data array to be read from the file.
 Opt. Outputs: 
	HEADER	 = String array containing the header for the FITS file.
 Keywords    : 
       /COMPRESS - If this keyword is set and non-zero, then then treat
                the file as gzip compressed.    By default FXREAD assumes
                the file is gzip compressed if it ends in &quot;.gz&quot;
	NANVALUE = Value signalling data dropout.  All points corresponding to
		   IEEE NaN (not-a-number) are set to this value.  Ignored
		   unless DATA is of type float or double-precision.
       EXTENSION = FITS extension.  It can be a scalar integer,
                indicating the extension number (extension number 0
                is the primary HDU).  It can also be a scalar string,
                indicating the extension name (EXTNAME keyword).
                Default: 0 (primary HDU)
	PROMPT	 = If set, then the optional parameters are prompted for at the
		   keyboard.
	AVERAGE	 = If set, then the array size is reduced by averaging pixels
		   together rather than by subselecting pixels.  Ignored unless
		   STEP is nontrivial.  Note:  this is much slower.
	YSTEP	 = If passed, then STEP is the step size in the 1st dimension,
		   and YSTEP is the step size in the 2nd dimension.  Otherwise,
		   STEP applies to both directions.
	NOSCALE	 = If set, then the output data will not be scaled using the
		   optional BSCALE and BZERO keywords in the FITS header.
		   Default is to scale, if and only if BSCALE and BZERO are
		   present and nontrivial.
	NOUPDATE = If set, then the optional BSCALE and BZERO keywords in the
		   optional HEADER array will not be changed.  The default is
		   to reset these keywords to BSCALE=1, BZERO=0.  Ignored if
		   NOSCALE is set.
	ERRMSG   = If defined and passed, then any error messages will be
		   returned to the user in this parameter rather than
		   depending on the MESSAGE routine in IDL.  If no errors are
		   encountered, then a null string is returned.  In order to
		   use this feature, ERRMSG must be defined first, e.g.

			ERRMSG = ''
			FXREAD, ERRMSG=ERRMSG, ...
			IF ERRMSG NE '' THEN ...
       NODATA   = If set, then the array is not read in, but the
                  primary header is read.

 Calls       : 
	GET_DATE, FXADDPAR, FXHREAD, FXPAR, WHERENAN
 Common      : 
	None.
 Restrictions: 
	Groups are not supported.

	The optional parameters I1, I2, and STEP only work with one or
	two-dimensional arrays.  J1 and J2 only work with two-dimensional
	arrays.

	Use of the AVERAGE keyword is not compatible with arrays with missing
	pixels.

 Side effects: 
	If the keywords BSCALE and BZERO are present in the FITS header, and
	have non-trivial values, then the returned array DATA is formed by the
	equation

			DATA = BSCALE*original + BZERO

	However, this behavior can overridden by using the /NOSCALE keyword.

	If the data is scaled, then the optional HEADER array is changed so
	that BSCALE=1 and BZERO=0.  This is so that these scaling parameters
	are not applied to the data a second time by another routine.  Also,
	history records are added storing the original values of these
	constants.  Note that only the returned array is modified--the header
	in the FITS file itself is untouched.

	If the /NOUPDATE keyword is set, however, then the BSCALE and BZERO
	keywords are not changed.  It is then the user's responsibility to
	ensure that these parameters are not reapplied to the data.  In
	particular, these keywords should not be present in any header when
	writing another FITS file, unless the user wants their values to be
	applied when the file is read back in.  Otherwise, FITS readers will
	read in the wrong values for the data array.

 NAME: 
	FXWRITE
 Purpose     : 
	Write a disk FITS file.
 Explanation : 
       Creates or appends to a disk FITS file and writes a FITS
       header, and optionally an image data array.
 Use         : 
	FXWRITE, FILENAME, HEADER [, DATA ]
 Inputs      : 
	FILENAME = String containing the name of the file to be written.
	HEADER	 = String array containing the header for the FITS file.
 Opt. Inputs : 
	DATA	 = IDL data array to be written to the file.  If not passed,
		   then it is assumed that extensions will be added to the
		   file.
 Outputs     : 
	None.
 Opt. Outputs: 
	None.
 Keywords    : 
	NANVALUE = Value signalling data dropout.  All points corresponding to
		   this value are set to be IEEE NaN (not-a-number).  Ignored
		   unless DATA is of type float, double-precision or complex.
	NOUPDATE = If set, then the optional BSCALE and BZERO keywords in the
		   HEADER array will not be changed.  The default is to reset
		   these keywords to BSCALE=1, BZERO=0.
       APPEND = If set, then an existing file will be appended to.
                Appending to a non-existent file will create it.  If
                a primary HDU already exists then it will be modified
                to have EXTEND = T.
       ALLOW_DEGEN = If set, then don't check for degenerate axes in
                     CHECK_FITS.
	ERRMSG	 = If defined and passed, then any error messages will be
		   returned to the user in this parameter rather than
		   depending on the MESSAGE routine in IDL.  If no errors are
		   encountered, then a null string is returned.  In order to
		   use this feature, ERRMSG must be defined first, e.g.

			ERRMSG = ''
			FXWRITE, ERRMSG=ERRMSG, ...
			IF ERRMSG NE '' THEN ...

 Calls       : 
	CHECK_FITS, GET_DATE, FXADDPAR, FXPAR
 Common      : 
	None.
 Restrictions: 
	If DATA is passed, then HEADER must be consistent with it.  If no data
	array is being written to the file, then HEADER must also be consistent
	with that.  The routine FXHMAKE can be used to create a FITS header.

	If found, then the optional keywords BSCALE and BZERO in the HEADER
	array is changed so that BSCALE=1 and BZERO=0.  This is so that these
	scaling parameters are not applied to the data a second time by another
	routine.  Also, history records are added storing the original values
	of these constants.  (Other values of BZERO are used for unsigned
	integers.)

	If the /NOUPDATE keyword is set, however, then the BSCALE and BZERO
	keywords are not changed.  The user should then be aware that FITS
	readers will apply these numbers to the data, even if the data is
	already converted to floating point form.

	Groups are not supported.

 Side effects: 
	HEADER may be modified.  One way it may be modified is describe
       above under NOUPDATE.  The first header card may also be
       modified to conform to the FITS standard if it does not
       already agree (i.e. use of either the SIMPLE or XTENSION
       keyword depending on whether the image is the primary HDU or
       not).
 Category    : 
	Data Handling, I/O, FITS, Generic.
 Prev. Hist. : 
	W. Thompson, Jan 1992, from WRITEFITS by J. Woffard and W. Landsman.
	Differences include:

		* Made DATA array optional, and HEADER array mandatory.
		* Changed order of HEADER and DATA parameters.
		* No attempt made to fix HEADER array.

	W. Thompson, May 1992, changed open statement to force 2880 byte fixed
			       length records (VMS).  The software here does not
